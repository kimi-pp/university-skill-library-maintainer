# Submit Assessments - Send Approved Grades to Canvas

Submit approved assessments from the JSON file to the Canvas gradebook.

## Task Overview

Review approved assessments, preview submission, and send grades to Canvas with safety checks.

## Step 1: Locate Assessment File

**If course_id and assignment_id provided**:

- Look for `.claude/assessments/{{course_id}}_{{assignment_id}}_*.json` in the current repository
- Use most recent file matching that pattern

**If no arguments provided**:

- Check `.claude/state/assessment_state.json` for last used file
- If state file exists, use that assessment file
- If not found, search for `assessments_*.json` and use most recent
- If no files found, report error and tell user to run `/assess:setup` first

## Step 2: Load and Validate Assessment File

Read the assessment JSON file using the Read tool. Validate structure and compute statistics.

Display validation summary:

```
Assessment File Status
======================

File: {assessment_file_path}
Assignment: {assignment_name}
Course: {course_name}

Assessments Overview:
  Total submissions: X
  Reviewed: Y (AI-evaluated)
  Approved: Z (ready to submit)
  Not reviewed: W

Score Statistics (approved only):
  Average: {avg} / 20 pts
  Range: {min} - {max} pts
```

## Step 3: Dry Run Preview

Run the dauber CLI submit command without `--confirm` to get a dry run:

```bash
uv run dauber assess submit {assessment_file_path} {course_id} {assignment_id} --format json
```

This shows what would be submitted without making changes. Build and display a preview from the assessment file data:

```
Submission Preview (DRY RUN)
============================

WILL BE SUBMITTED (Z approved):
  User {user_id} - {total_pts}/{points_possible} pts
    - {criterion1}: {pts1}/{max1}
    - {criterion2}: {pts2}/{max2}
    - ...
  (list all criteria from rubric)

WILL BE SKIPPED:
  User {user_id} - not approved (needs review)
  User {user_id} - already graded in Canvas (protected)
  ...

NO SUBMISSION (W students):
  - User {user_id} - no submission to grade
  ...
```

## Step 4: Confirm Submission

Ask user for confirmation:

```
Ready to submit Z approved assessments to Canvas?

This will:

  - Submit grades for Z students
  - Skip X unapproved assessments
  - Post rubric scores and feedback to Canvas
  - Mark submitted assessments in JSON file

Continue? (Y/n)
```

Use `AskUserQuestion` tool with:

- Question: "Submit approved assessments to Canvas gradebook?"
- Options: ["Yes - submit to Canvas", "No - cancel submission"]

## Step 5: Submit to Canvas

**If user confirms YES**:

Run the dauber CLI submit command with `--confirm`:

```bash
uv run dauber assess submit {assessment_file_path} {course_id} {assignment_id} --confirm --format json
```

Report results:

```
Submission Complete
===================

Successfully Submitted: X students
  User {user_id} - {total_pts}/{points_possible} pts posted to Canvas
  ...

Skipped:
  Not approved: Y students
  Already graded in Canvas: Z students (protected)
  ...

Failed (errors): W students
  User {user_id} - Error: {error_message}
  ...

Grades Posted to Canvas: X/{total_submissions}
Assessment File Updated
```

**If user cancels**:

- Report: "Submission cancelled. No grades posted to Canvas."
- Exit without making changes

## Step 6: Update State

Update `.claude/state/assessment_state.json` with:

```json
{
  "last_assessment_file": "{file_path}",
  "course_id": "{course_id}",
  "assignment_id": "{assignment_id}",
  "last_submission_time": "{timestamp}",
  "total_submitted": X,
  "total_approved": Y,
  "total_skipped": Z
}
```

## Post-Submission Summary

```
Final Summary
=============

Assignment: {assignment_name}
Course: {course_name}

Grading Complete:
  X students graded in Canvas
  Y students pending approval
  - Z students no submission

Class Performance (submitted grades):
  Average: {avg}/{points_possible} pts ({percentage}%)

  Criterion Averages:
  - {criterion1}: {avg1}/{max1} pts
  - {criterion2}: {avg2}/{max2} pts
  - ...
  (list all criteria from rubric)

Assessment File: {file_path}
  Preserved as audit trail with submission timestamps

Next Steps:
  - Review skipped assessments if any
  - Check Canvas gradebook to verify grades posted
  - Follow up with students who didn't submit
```

## Error Handling

- If no approved assessments: Report warning, ask if user wants to review assessments first
- If submission fails for any student: Report error but continue with others
- If Canvas API error: Report error with details, preserve assessment file
- If assessment file not found: Report error, tell user to run setup/prelim first

## Important Notes

- ALWAYS runs dry-run preview first before actual submission
- ONLY submits assessments explicitly marked as "approved"
- **Protects existing Canvas grades by default** (won't overwrite already-graded)
- Skips unapproved assessments and already-graded submissions
- Preserves assessment file as audit trail
- Updates JSON with submission timestamps
- No grades can be submitted without human approval
- Safe to run multiple times (won't duplicate submissions or overwrite existing grades)

Begin submission process now.
