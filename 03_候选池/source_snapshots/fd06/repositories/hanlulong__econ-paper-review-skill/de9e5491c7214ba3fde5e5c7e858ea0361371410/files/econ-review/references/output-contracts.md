# Output Contracts

Use `findings.json` as the canonical detailed state. Paths in this reference are relative to the canonical package root, which new runs place at `review/supporting/`. Contract v0.4 adds source-grounded evidence, compositional audit burdens, canonical paper order, structured verification/computation/external-source records, and fail-closed finalization while retaining the v0.3 referee presentation. Derive `synthesis.json`, the substance `report.md`, companion `editing-comments.md`, unified `fix-plan.md`, and deterministic `paper-review.pdf` from canonical state. Existing v0.1–v0.3 reviews remain valid under their declared contracts without migration.

The clean parent delivery contains only `review/README.md`, `review/paper-review.pdf`, `review/reports/`, and `review/supporting/`. The PDF is the primary reader artifact and includes only author-facing documents indexed by `review-manifest.json`: the referee report, editing comments when present, revision plan, prior-round progress when present, and a deliberately written plain-language supplementary summary when it materially helps the author. Coverage matrices, source ledgers, package checks, raw JSON, anchors, hashes, schemas, gates, and receipts remain under `supporting/` for later agents and validation. Selecting the whole parent folder in Review Desk still works because the viewer discovers the nested review state automatically.

The installed schemas and validator support v0.4, v0.3, v0.2, and legacy v0.1. New reviews use v0.4. Select the contract explicitly in `run.json`; never relabel an existing review merely to obtain a new presentation or trust marker. Current full v0.4 finalizations use receipt schema v0.3 and carry `structured_audit_v02` plus `burden_coverage_v02`; they require candidates, claims, analytical-audit, coverage, external-sources, and writing schemas v0.1, v0.2, v0.2, v0.2, v0.4, and v0.4 respectively, plus figures v0.2 whenever figures are present and tables v0.2 whenever tables are present. Current quick finalizations use receipt schema v0.2 without either full-review gate. Immutable v0.4 receipt schemas v0.1 and v0.2 remain readable and verifiable under the guarantees that created them; they do not acquire the newer trust claim unless regenerated.

## `README.md` — v0.3/v0.4 start-here page

Generate this author-facing landing page from `run.json`, `synthesis.json`, `findings.json`, and the available human-readable artifacts. It must show the reviewer posture, active comment counts, reading order, principal concerns, a concise three-line account of what was and was not checked, and a file map. Keep the full assessment boundary in canonical state; do not reintroduce an `Assessment Boundary` section into either author-facing report.

State plainly that the Markdown reports and plan are complete without the optional local viewer. Explain that checking a plan item records author progress but does not close a finding: later review must verify the `resolved_when` evidence. If `review-actions.json` is used, gloss author dispositions in ordinary language and point to the handoff protocol.

## `paper-review.pdf` and reader delivery

Generate `paper-review.pdf` deterministically from the synchronized author-facing manifest documents after the Markdown reports and plan. Its cover contains only the clean manuscript title from `run.json.paper_title`, “Referee Report,” and the assessment date. Do not add a generic product title, execution mode, audience label, recommendation, comment count, workflow explanation, or summary card to the cover. Use the manuscript title as the PDF title metadata and “Referee Report” as its subject; keep product, mode, and audience labels out of metadata as well.

The visible table of contents must be useful without becoming an index of comments. Include every reader-facing document and selected level-two sections that help the author navigate the review, such as Overall Assessment, Main Grounds, Detailed Comments, Highest-Return Editing Revisions, Detailed Editing Comments, and the P0/P1/P2 revision-plan sections. Include prior-round progress when present. Exclude individual comments and lower-level audit headings from the visible contents; deeper PDF bookmarks may remain useful. Preserve quoted evidence, comment field order, tables, lists, code or equations, headings, and page numbers. Never include internal audit documents or raw state.

Keep `Status` as the last field in Markdown and Review Desk, where it supports the revision cycle. Omit the repeated `Status: [Pending]` line from the static PDF because it cannot update there and makes a finalized report look unfinished.

The controlled Markdown emitter and professional LaTeX template are the preferred path. In `auto` mode, use a compatible LuaLaTeX toolchain or explicitly installed Tectonic renderer when available and record the selection in an internal renderer profile. Use the maintained ReportLab implementation only when no supported TeX renderer is available. Once a TeX renderer has been selected, a conversion or compilation failure stops finalization and leaves any prior verified PDF untouched; never hide the failure by switching to ReportLab. Pandoc is neither bundled nor required. Keep the renderer profile, engine/version details, template identity, and compilation diagnostics in internal supporting state; do not expose them in the cover, contents, reports, or reader landing page. `--check` reuses the recorded renderer profile rather than auto-selecting another backend and must reproduce the accepted artifact. No installer or report-generation command may install or alter a system TeX distribution automatically.

For a new run, finalize the canonical `review/supporting/` package. Finalization automatically projects its PDF and Markdown reader copies to the parent while leaving machine state and evidence nested. For an immutable legacy package whose receipt predates PDF delivery, render the PDF only into a separate reader delivery; do not add it to the frozen canonical directory or rewrite old schemas. The parent delivery is rebuildable and is not itself the canonical signed state. Never delete or flatten `supporting/` merely to make the file browser look cleaner.

## `run.json`

Validate against `assets/run.schema.json`. Record:

- schema version and run status;
- a clean, nonempty `paper_title` verified against the manuscript; current finalization fails if the value is missing, generic, equation-derived, or an extraction artifact;
- legacy `mode` plus explicit `requested_mode` and `delivered_mode`, target venue/tier, paper family, and detected designs. Keep `mode` equal to `delivered_mode`. Ordinarily the two explicit modes match and `mode_transition` is `none`. A failed full review remains failed; a separately delivered quick replacement uses a new `review_id`, records `separate_quick_after_failed_full`, names the failed review in `transition_source_review_id`, and explains the transition. Never mutate the failed full package into quick mode;
- `requested_addons`: an explicit inventory of optional author-facing analyses; current full reviews use `[]` when none were requested and add `journal_fit` only after an explicit venue-analysis request;
- source inventory and assessment boundary;
- identity handling (`identity_minimized`, `blinded`, or `not_applied`);
- stage states and lenses loaded;
- literature and code-execution availability;
- counts by severity and verification state;
- `finding_granularity`: `one_per_defect`, `one_per_occurrence`, or a clearly named consolidation policy; exact active defect, occurrence, and evidence-record counts; and `related_locations` as the occurrence ledger. Consolidation may reduce finding count but never discard a checked occurrence or its location;
- `provenance`: the source revision/digest and dirty state when available; operating system and runtime versions; package versions; renderer, semantic, and OCR backends; exact invocation; model/prompt identities when exposed; and the observed agent count. Use explicit `null` only when a value truly cannot be observed. The package hash binds this record;
- `comment_policy`: requested minimum target; deprecated aggregate `maximum: null`; author-facing `substance_maximum: 100` and `writing_maximum: 30`; and exhaustive-coverage state. Channel maxima are publication capacities, not search limits or targets. Discovery continues to source/burden closure, and unresolved overflow blocks completion rather than truncating active findings. Bounded quick and legacy contracts retain their declared behavior.
- for v0.4, `activated_burdens`: a precise row `id`, one stable conceptual `parent_id` from the design audit, object type, `active`/`not_applicable` state, activation basis, source/claim/required-omission triggers, and a reason for every `not_applicable` burden. The parent classifies the row; do not add a duplicate alias or parent row. Completed full runs must decide and self-parent `logical_validity`, `technical_validity`, and `methodological_validity` explicitly.
- for completed split-report runs, `telemetry`: the names of passes actually completed, the number of agents spawned, observed wall-clock/token counts when the runtime exposes them, and per-stage elapsed seconds recorded by `scripts/review_timing.py`. Use `null` for unavailable timing or token counts; never estimate them. Start timing after `run.json` exists, use one coordinator to record stage transitions, transition to `delivery` before finalization, and let the finalizer complete the timing transaction.

Do not fabricate a manuscript, source-tree, version, timing, model, or prompt value. Record unavailable provenance as `null`.

Within the assessment boundary, use `not_present` for figures or equations only after the complete rendered paper has been checked and the absence confirmed. Use `not_assessed` when the check was not performed; never collapse these two states.

## `review-actions.json` — optional author-response sidecar

Validate a supplied or viewer-exported handoff against `assets/review-actions.schema.json` and follow [review-actions-handoff.md](review-actions-handoff.md). This sidecar records author dispositions, personal P0/P1/P2 priorities, reviewed state, optional notes, timestamps, and append-only history. It does not alter `findings.json`: `ready_for_recheck` and `challenged` request another review; they are not verified resolution or counterevidence. `deferred` remains open until a later review verifies otherwise. `not_relevant` and `not_addressable` remain auditable but suppress that exact finding ID from the next-round active reports, queue, and plan. Keep `run.review_id` stable only across intentional rounds on the same manuscript lineage, and keep a finding ID only for the same underlying issue.

## Revision-agent handoff — optional iterative sidecars

Review Desk exports `revision-tasks.json`, `revision-agent-brief.md`, and `revision-response.template.json` from the same committed action snapshot after the user works through the comments. Validate the task payload against `assets/revision-tasks.schema.json` and the returned response against `assets/agent-response.schema.json` through `scripts/validate_revision_handoff.py`. The task payload binds the exact BOM-free UTF-8 `findings.json` bytes by SHA-256, exact finding IDs, reviewed states, user comments, personal priorities, canonical issue/evidence/repair text, and a stable plan ID. `handoff_ready` is true only when every comment is reviewed, every active task has a P0/P1/P2 priority, and every active or excluded comment has a nonblank user note. Deferred and excluded comments appear only in its excluded appendix.

An implementation agent returns `revision-response.json` with the same plan and review identities, exact task IDs, direct responses, changed files and locations, checks, results, and blockers. `changed`, `response_only`, `partial`, and `blocked` describe the agent's work; none is reviewer resolution. Follow [revision-cycle.md](revision-cycle.md): inspect the revised source and closure condition independently, adjudicate every prior active finding, then run a fresh exhaustive review for new or repair-induced problems.

## Prior-round reconciliation — optional v0.4 round state

Activate this contract only for an intentional later round on the same manuscript lineage. Store immutable copies of the prior `findings.json`, exported `review-actions.json`, `revision-tasks.json`, and optional `revision-response.json` directly under `evidence/prior-round/`; declare those exact paths in `run.json.prior_round`. Do not point at mutable files outside the package.

Create `evidence/round-reconciliation.json` against `assets/round-reconciliation.schema.json`. Bind every snapshot by raw SHA-256 and the task plan ID. Record one reviewer-owned adjudication for each prior plan row in plan order, then list every genuinely new current finding ID. The adjudication may use `resolved`, `partly_resolved`, `unchanged`, `superseded`, or `user_excluded` only under the evidence rules in [revision-cycle.md](revision-cycle.md). Always include `successor_consolidations`; use `[]` when every successor has one prior owner. If a current finding consolidates two or more superseded prior findings, add one row naming that current ID, every contributing prior ID in plan order, and the reason for consolidation. The validator rejects undeclared repeated successors, partial membership, duplicate declarations, unknown IDs, and consolidation members whose outcomes are not `superseded`. Exact user exclusions remain successor-free. An implementation-agent status is evidence about attempted work, never the outcome. Preserve user and agent prose in their hashed snapshots rather than duplicating it in reviewer-authored reconciliation fields.

Generate `evidence/round-reconciliation.md` deterministically from the reconciliation and its bound snapshots. It is a human-facing overview document titled “What changed since the prior review.” For each earlier comment it shows the issue title and text, the author's exact instruction, and—when supplied—an ordinary-language implementation update, exact response, and reported changed locations, followed by a clearly separate reviewer conclusion, rationale, related current-comment titles, and checks. Consolidated successors and genuinely new comments appear by title. Do not expose finding IDs, plan bindings, schema or hash language, outcome enums, agent-status enums, anchor IDs, or computation IDs in visible prose. Preserve stable IDs and enum bindings only in canonical JSON and hidden HTML comments, which the PDF renderer removes. Also omit event histories and unrelated response metadata. Declare the document once in `review-manifest.json`, after `report.md` and before the editing comments and revision plan in reader order. The referee-report opening gives only resolved, still-active, user-excluded, and new counts plus a link to this document. The PDF and clean delivery include the same readable projection. Exact user-excluded IDs cannot return as active findings; a materially different concern uses a new ID.

## `review-manifest.json` — v0.3/v0.4 document index

Validate against `assets/review-manifest.schema.json`. Contracts v0.3/v0.4 require the manifest; older packages use conservative standard-path discovery. List every author-facing Markdown report or plan intended for the local viewer with a stable ID, title, group (`overview`, `reports`, or `plan`), safe package-relative path, and order. Include the generated `README.md` as the first overview document. Use group `audit` only for backward compatibility; current generators keep those documents internal and the PDF/viewer do not expose them. A useful paper reconstruction or exhibit summary must be rewritten for the author and declared as a report, not linked directly from an internal matrix or ledger. Never list a manuscript or confidential file merely to make it deployable.

## `findings.json`

Validate against `assets/findings.schema.json`. Use stable IDs with informative prefixes such as `LOGIC-01`, `DESIGN-01`, `INFER-01`, `CLARITY-01`, `CONTRIB-01`, or `REPRO-01`.

Each finding must contain:

- a unique consecutive `importance_rank` determining the default report and viewer order. Assign it by severity first (`critical`, `major`, `minor`, `info`), then decision role, paper-specific consequence, and repair payoff; use manuscript position only as a final tie-breaker. A critical finding is a verified issue that can invalidate or make uninterpretable a central claim and could plausibly drive rejection. It must be potentially dispositive, essential before submission, and reviewer P0. Do not infer or upgrade severity from keywords, occurrence counts, quotas, or the desired recommendation;
- a paper-appropriate dimension label, severity, status, and essential flag. Dimension labels are intentionally open-ended so empirical, descriptive, experimental, structural, quantitative, macro, theoretical, and mixed papers are not forced into an irrelevant taxonomy; use stable descriptive labels such as `measurement`, `identification`, `proof`, `computation`, `interpretation`, `writing`, or `reporting`;
- `critique_basis`, identifying whether the concern is a formal error, identification/inference issue, avoidable data handling, claim overreach, internal inconsistency, reader-clarity problem, reporting/reproducibility issue, or contribution issue;
- `data_limitation`, classifying the concern under the reader-claim audit. Never leave an inherent, properly disclosed, claim-bounded limitation active;
- `claim_ids`, linking claim-related findings to the canonical claim-family audit, and `reader_effect`, stating what becomes unclear, inconsistent, overstated, or unconvincing for a reader;
- paper-specific issue and consequence;
- one or more typed evidence records;
- support state;
- confidence and what would change the assessment;
- strongest author reply, search scope, and completed fairness result for every substantive finding. A minor substantive finding may use a brief check. An objective source-verified mechanical correction records fairness as `not_applicable` rather than inventing an author-side defense;
- a proportionate fix strategy, effort, dependency, publishability rationale, and `resolved_when` condition stating the observable evidence that closes the comment, plus structured flags for whether the primary repair requires new data and whether the current design can support it. If an inherent data limit only creates claim overreach, require a no-new-data claim-narrowing alternative rather than requesting unavailable data;
- verification state.

Split-report contracts route each finding with `report_channel`:

- `substance` (the default): design, identification, theory, inference, results, contribution, reproducibility, load-bearing clarity, misleading expression, and citation-support problems;
- `writing`: grammar, spelling, article usage, language mechanics, terminology or label consistency, exhibit presentation, and optional style.

When in doubt, use `substance`. A writing problem that obscures the science and a citation that does not support a load-bearing claim are substantive. Contract v0.1 omits this field and keeps its existing report behavior.

Use `null` for genuinely inapplicable patch or refutation fields; do not use placeholder prose.

Contracts v0.3 and v0.4 require `title`, `decision_role`, and `repairability` for every finding. Use `decision_role` to distinguish rejection risk from technical severity:

- `potentially_dispositive`: could justify rejection if unresolved;
- `posture_material`: could change the recommendation independently or cumulatively;
- `revision_value`: a verified improvement that does not determine the posture;
- `polish`: writing, presentation, metadata, or optional refinement.

Use `repairability` to state the smallest credible route: current-design repair, claim narrowing, additional analysis, new evidence, redesign, unclear, or no clear fix. The legacy `essential` field mirrors `potentially_dispositive` only for compatibility with shared counts and older tooling.

Contract v0.4 also requires canonical `paper_position`; stable evidence IDs and representations; `evidence_boundary`; `minimum_repair`; one `display_evidence_id`; explicit related evidence/locations; and, in a current full review, one or more `candidate_ids` joining the finding to every admitted, weakened, or merged discovery row that it resolves. `related_locations` is the complete occurrence inventory for that defect concept, including locations consolidated into one finding; its aggregate count must reconcile to `run.json.finding_granularity`. Every evidence item resolves to a source anchor, checked scope, computation, or external-source record as its representation requires. Paper order comes from the source manifest, never lexical section labels.

## `synthesis.json` — v0.3/v0.4 referee synthesis

Validate against `assets/synthesis.schema.json`. Record the overall assessment, specific strengths, review posture, posture rationale, upgrade conditions, convincingness, companion writing count, and principal concerns. When both target venue and tier are unspecified, use `not_assessed` for the publication posture while retaining a decisive technical and revision assessment. A principal concern may group several findings with one root cause or several findings that jointly determine the posture. Every potentially dispositive finding must appear in a principal concern. Do not create a new concern during synthesis; all linked findings must already be active, verification-passed, and routed to substance. In v0.4, `support_mappings` must cover every overall-assessment, strength, posture, upgrade, principal-concern, and convincingness statement with resolving claim, finding, and/or evidence IDs. Current strict full reviews resolve claim IDs only from anchored canonical claim families, never from a finding's self-declared links. Finding and evidence support is eligible only while the owning finding remains active and verification-passed; every evidence ID must name its reciprocal finding owner in the same mapping. A clean strength uses one or more precisely anchored canonical claims without adverse finding evidence. Each principal-concern rationale and upgrade mapping uses exactly that concern's linked active, verification-passed findings. These rules keep a dismissed concern, failed verification, or orphaned quotation from silently supporting the referee synthesis.

## `report.md` — v0.3/v0.4 substance report

Immediately below the H1 title, add one compact `Review files` line linking `README.md`, `report.md`, `editing-comments.md` when present, and `fix-plan.md`. Do not link an audit trail. Rewrite these links when projecting the renamed copies under `review/reports/` so every reader link remains valid.

Use this structure:

```markdown
# Referee Report

## Overall assessment
[A cohesive referee narrative: question, design/model, evidence, main answer, verified contribution, specific strengths, and bottom-line credibility judgment.]

## Recommendation and main grounds
**Recommendation**: [Reject / Weak R&R / Strong R&R / Accept / Not assessed]

[Explain why the assessment follows, what is repairable, and what observable revision would change it.]

## Issues that could prevent publication
### 1. [Principal concern title]
<!-- principal_concern_id: PC-01 -->
<!-- linked_finding_ids: LOGIC-01 -->
[State the claim, evidence delivered, exact gap, decision consequence, repairability in plain language, and upgrade condition. Keep stable links in hidden metadata.]

## Other major issues
[Synthesize every posture-material finding not already grouped above without exposing internal IDs.]

## Is the argument convincing?
[State which links in the central claim-evidence-warrant chain are convincing, which remain provisional, and the smallest concrete changes that would make the argument persuasive.]

## Closest literature and key differences
[Include only when verified public comparators materially affect contribution framing. State the bottom-line contribution judgment; explain what each distinct prior work does, the exact overlap, the meaningful difference, whether the manuscript's claim is convincing, and the minimum fair reframing. Mention each intellectual work once even when it bears on several claims or has several versions.]

## Detailed Comments (N)

### 1. Section 3.1: [short issue title]

**Issue**: [One-sentence diagnosis matching the canonical ledger issue.]

**Relevant text**:
[Use a block quote for manuscript text. Use an unquoted note for reviewer observations, comparisons, computations, or checked absences.]

**Concern**: [Explain what the paper establishes, the missing logical or evidentiary step, and which claim or interpretation is affected. Make the reasoning self-contained.]

**Suggestions**: [Give the minimum concrete repair, explain why it resolves the concern, and add one decisive check only if the broader claim is retained.]

**Status**: [Pending]
```

The literature section is optional, but its position is fixed when present: after `Is the argument convincing?` and immediately before `Detailed Comments`. Project it from canonical work families, claim assessments, literature comparisons, and candidate screenings. Preserve claim-specific comparison rows internally while deduplicating the author-facing discussion by intellectual work. `fair_restatement` must be substitute-ready manuscript language, while `recommended_change` carries the editing instruction. Use complete referee prose; do not expose source IDs or audit labels, repeat a source by claim, or assemble fragments with stock clauses.

Render `Relevant text` from the finding's designated display evidence. Render `verbatim` records and normalized source transcriptions as quotations. Render reviewer observations, comparisons, computations, and checked absences as unquoted evidence notes, without internal bracket labels such as `[Reviewer observation]`. Canonical `representation` metadata—not a prose prefix—preserves provenance. A composite comparison must cite at least two source anchors and verify every cited component. Never make reviewer prose, a composite comparison, an omission, or a computed result look like manuscript text. Multi-location findings list the related checked anchors in `Concern`. When evidence declares `locator.page`, that page must agree with every referenced source anchor; leave it null for cross-page composites until the contract defines explicit anchor roles. Legacy canonical content may retain a matching prefix, but deterministic report generation removes it.

Keep canonical provenance and author-facing location labels separate. Source-manifest and writing-occurrence `locator` values retain the exact source locator needed for reconciliation, including ingestion geometry and stable IDs when present. Reports, PDF output, and Review Desk must never display bounding boxes, source IDs, anchor IDs, block IDs, hashes, extraction methods, or audit key-value syntax. Use a readable section, exhibit, paragraph, equation, or page label. A PDF ingestion locator may reduce deterministically to `PDF p. N`; if no safe label can be derived, supply the writing occurrence's `reader_locator` and fail completion when it is absent or itself exposes provenance. Hidden canonical metadata remains available to validators and later review rounds.

Set `N` to the actual number of surviving substance-channel comments, normally `0..100` under the current full contract. Do not pad toward the capacity, stop discovery when it is reached, or truncate active findings. If more than 100 independently defensible substance findings remain after true-root consolidation, pause completion for explicit user resolution. Sort by `importance_rank`, not manuscript order. The rank is globally severity-first: all critical findings precede all major findings, all major precede all minor findings, and informational observations come last; decision role and repair payoff order findings only within a severity tier. Number comments consecutively and use the visible format exactly:

```markdown
### {number}. {location}: {short issue title}

**Issue**: {canonical issue}

**Relevant text**:
{quoted source excerpt or unquoted evidence note}

**Concern**: {evidence boundary and paper-specific consequence}

**Suggestions**: {minimum concrete repair and any necessary decisive check}

**Status**: [Pending]
```

Use the field meanings in [comment-style.md](comment-style.md). `Concern` diagnoses without repeating `Issue`; `Suggestions` starts with the minimum defensible repair and omits recommendation signposting. Keep `fix.what`, `fix.how`, and the full resolution condition distinct in `findings.json`. For critical and major findings, state the affirmative evidence boundary (`the paper establishes X; it does not yet establish Y`) and the paper-specific consequence. For an inherent data limit, say explicitly that the concern is claim scope rather than the data constraint and lead with a no-new-data repair.

Apply the clarity register in [comment-style.md](comment-style.md). Each comment must stand on its own and walk the author through the full chain from evidence to concern to repair. Open with the concrete problem, gloss reviewer-introduced non-obvious acronyms and load-bearing specialist terms, explain what a named diagnostic checks, identify the paper-specific conclusion or object at risk, and explain why the suggested change is sufficient. Use natural, collegial prose; remove machine-like audit narration and compressed shorthand. Merge overlapping repair prose rather than concatenating it. These are semantic requirements; automated lints intentionally cover only high-confidence surface failures.

Do not use repeated courtroom or competitor-style boilerplate such as `As written`, `the strongest author-side defense`, `supports that defense only to this extent`, `a proportionate repair`, `there seems to be an issue`, or `the document would benefit from`. Do not mechanically lowercase titles into prose. Preserve acronyms, proper names, exhibit labels, and mathematical notation. Titles must describe the observed object and consequence; reserve `invalid`, `incorrect`, `severe`, `fatal`, and similar labels for formally established errors.

Use `[Pending]` for open or challenged findings and place it as the final visible field. The active detailed-comment inventory excludes resolved, dismissed, and refuted candidates.

Place a machine-readable ledger link in a hidden Markdown comment immediately below each heading, for example `<!-- finding_id: LOGIC-01 -->`, so the visible format remains unchanged.

For an omission, quote the nearest statement that creates the disclosure burden, then explain the checked absence scope in `Concern`; do not invent a quote saying the paper omits something. For a table, figure, equation, or code finding, render the exact typed evidence in the block quote and name the exhibit or file in the heading.

For claim-consistency or overclaim findings, link all material occurrences in the ledger even when the visible quote shows only one representative sentence. Name the conflicting or qualifier-dropping locations in `Concern`.

Keep the synthesis prioritized even when the detailed-comment section is long. It will normally contain only a few root-cause essentials; preserve every independently or cumulatively dispositive concern. The 100-comment capacity does not impose a page, word, token, or per-comment prose limit: give every comment enough space for evidence, consequence, fairness, and a concrete repair. Put writing mechanics, venue analysis, scope, and verification logs in their designated companion or evidence files, not in the substance report, and never shorten substantive feedback to meet a length norm.

## `editing-comments.md` — v0.3/v0.4 companion report

Full mode requires this separate report. Quick mode creates it only when writing-channel findings exist or the user requests writing analysis. Journal fit is an opt-in addendum.

```markdown
# Editing comments

## Editing assessment
[Reader-facing diagnosis, specific strengths, and overall revision priority.]

## Highest-return editing revisions
[Three to five concise, ranked actions linked, where useful, by visible comment number.]

## Section-by-section reader audit
[For each relevant section: current job, what works, reader friction, revision direction, and visible related-comment references where useful. Adapt the lens to the paper type.]

## Terminology, definitions, and notation
[Canonical terms, treatment/group labels, units, horizons, abbreviations, variables, and cross-reference style.]

## Tables and figures as writing
[Caption self-containment, titles, units, continuation headings, accessibility, and layout. Route scientifically misleading exhibit content to the substance report.]

## Mechanics and copyedit inventory
[Exact corrections grouped by rule, with a readable section, exhibit, paragraph, equation, or page location and reader consequence in natural prose. Preserve exact source locators, bounding boxes, IDs, and render checks in canonical evidence rather than exposing audit syntax.]

## Style and writing improvements
[Concrete optional or recommended revisions plus the redundancy map. Distinguish objective corrections from matters of style.]

## Detailed Editing Comments (N)

### 1. Section 3.1: [short writing issue title]
<!-- finding_id: WRT-01 -->

**Issue**: [Exact writing, consistency, or presentation problem.]

**Relevant text**:
> [Exact manuscript evidence]

**Concern**: [Why the expression is incorrect, inconsistent, or difficult to read.]

**Suggestions**: [The exact replacement or bounded edit sequence.]

**Status**: [Pending]
```

Set `N` to the active editing-channel count, normally `0..30` under the current full contract. The canonical `report_channel` value remains `writing`; this is an internal compatibility field, not the report's reader-facing name. Use the same hidden finding link and issue-first, status-last contract as `report.md`. Editing comments are normally compact. Both reports preserve global `importance_rank`; visible numbering is consecutive within each report. The 30-comment capacity is neither a target nor a discovery limit; if true-root consolidation leaves more than 30 verified editing findings, pause completion rather than omit them. Do not impose a page, word, token, or per-comment prose limit. Current full packages use writing-audit schema v0.4 and generate the seven core sections above entirely from `evidence/writing.json`; hand-edited or stale preambles fail synchronization.

Add `## Journal fit and submission strategy` only when `run.json.requested_addons` contains `journal_fit`. When the add-on is absent, record `venue_fit.status: not_requested` and emit no placeholder section or dated/candidate/finding payload. When requested and current literature access exists, give 3–6 candidate journals. For each, cite dated official scope evidence, verify 1–2 recent comparator papers with HTTPS links and access dates, state the evidence standard currently met versus still needed, and include verifiable format constraints when relevant. Evidence dates cannot be later than the venue assessment date or current date. Give an ambitious-to-safe sequence and revision-contingent fit. Use qualitative tiers only and never invent acceptance probabilities. If search is unavailable, mark the requested assessment `bounded`.

Do not put an `Assessment Boundary` section in either author-facing report. The landing page may include concise `What was reviewed` and, only when relevant, `What could not be checked` sections. Keep matrices and technical scope state under `supporting/`.

The split is presentational, not a loss of coverage. `fix-plan.md`, counts, coverage, and evidence artifacts continue to cover all active findings across both channels exactly once.

## `fix-plan.md`

Start with: “Objective: improve the paper for [venue/tier or intended audience] by resolving the verified concerns below.”

Use:

- **P0 — before submission:** every critical and every other essential issue, with all critical items first and then dependency ordered without crossing the severity boundary.
- **P1 — strengthens the paper:** major correctable items ranked by payoff relative to effort.
- **P2 — optional polish:** minor items only.

Include every active detailed comment exactly once in P0, P1, or P2. No critical finding may depend on a lower-severity finding that would have to precede it; merge the shared root cause or align the classifications. A long exhaustive review may therefore have a long fix plan. These are reviewer repair tiers. The author's separate P0/P1/P2 choices in Review Desk remain personal implementation priorities and never rewrite severity or `importance_rank`.

Render the author action as a Markdown task checkbox while retaining a stable finding-ID heading for reconciliation. At the top, say only that the author should work from P0 to P2 and that a later review compares each revision with its **Done when** condition. Keep Review Desk controls, disposition vocabulary, export filenames, and agent-handoff instructions in the reader landing page and viewer rather than repeating them in the revision plan or PDF. User priority is a planning override and never changes referee severity.

For each item include:

- finding ID;
- objective and exact steps;
- affected sections, equations, tables, figures, or code;
- prerequisite items;
- estimated effort (`hours`, `days`, `weeks`, `new-data`, or `not-estimable`);
- decisive completion evidence;
- objection preempted and publishability payoff;
- whether the current design can support the fix.

Render `Done when` from the finding's own `fix.resolved_when` and `Payoff` from `fix.publishability`. Reject migration boilerplate such as `ID closes when...`, `The revised paper implements this repair...`, or `Closing ID removes the submission risk...`; do not reconstruct either field from the action, issue, or severity at presentation time.

Do not convert an unfixable issue into a long task list. State the portfolio choice: redesign, narrow the claim, collect new evidence, or retarget.

## Evidence files

- `evidence/candidates.json`: current full-review discovery ledger. It records every independent pass, its exact source-unit and active-burden scope, and every provisional candidate with a final `admitted`, `weakened`, `refuted`, `merged`, or `bounded` disposition. Retained rows map bidirectionally to active findings; merged rows name one non-merged target; rejected or bounded rows retain a concrete reason. Discovery passes collectively cover every in-scope unit and active burden. Fewer than 30 substantive survivors trigger one complete `low_count_recovery` pass without creating a quota. Saturation passes join exactly to `coverage.json.second_sweep.rounds`, and the final complete pass revisits the whole in-scope review boundary while adding zero retained findings.
- `evidence/source-manifest.json`: v0.4 source hashes, normalized extractions, stable anchors, and source-derived paper order. Manuscript, appendix, supplement, supplied bibliography, supplied-code, and supplied-data-dictionary rows are internal sources and join exactly to `run.json.assessment_boundary`; external literature records stay outside that boundary in `external-sources.json`. A separate `.bib` or reference file uses the `bibliography` role so citation keys and records can be anchored without treating that file as manuscript prose.
- `evidence/verification.json`: v0.4 finding-by-evidence verification records; every pass resolves to an anchor, computation, external source, or checked-absence scope.
- `evidence/computations.json`: v0.4 reproducible numerical/algebraic checks with input anchors, tool/method, tolerance, result artifact, and hash. Legacy computation schema v0.1 requires reciprocal finding links. Schema v0.2 also permits a clean audit-only computation when its `audit_links` match exactly the analytical entry or magnitude assessment that canonically cites it; orphan and one-way links fail validation.
- `evidence/external-sources.json`: new or re-finalized full reviews use schema v0.4. Every material literature-facing manuscript claim maps to internal claim IDs and exact anchors, query families, claim-level coverage, a source-supported assessment, and a fair restatement. Structured source records preserve ordered authors, authoritative metadata, earliest public date, work family, correction or retraction status, and lawful capture policy. Candidate screening records every retained plausible result, including excluded and version-duplicate works, with citation status, temporal relation to the manuscript cutoff, materiality, disposition, proportionate action, and an exact insertion anchor and proposed positioning change when a citation is warranted. A source may support several claim-specific comparison rows; no main-result field or one-source-one-row rule is imposed.

  `complete` requires every inventoried claim to have completed claim-appropriate multi-route coverage, every retained result to have a screening decision, resolved or explicitly non-applicable citation chaining, completed current-frontier coverage through working papers, recent publications, or field syntheses as appropriate, no unresolved material candidate, and two final reasonable expansion rounds yielding no new material work. It imposes no candidate, comparator, journal, or paper-count quota. `bounded` and `not_assessed` retain structured reasons and completion conditions. Exact proposition-support records remain tied to saved UTF-8 spans and hashes; canonical metadata projections bind ordered authors, identifiers, dates, version chronology, and record status but cannot support substantive results, and partial or conflicting support carries an assessment note. Legacy schemas v0.3, v0.2, and v0.1 remain readable under their original guarantees.
- `evidence/reconstruction.md`: claim inventory, derivation ledger, methods map, digest.
- `evidence/reader-claim-audit.md`: reader map, cross-section claim ledger, economic argument and evidence audit, convincingness assessment, data-limitation classifications, and report-tone check.
- `evidence/claims.json`: schema-valid audit scope, claim families, canonical supported claims, occurrence comparisons, reader map, comprehensive terminology/variable definitions, structured central-argument assessment, and structured writing audit. New or re-finalized full reviews use claims-audit schema v0.2 and also record economic links, full comparison or intervention content, cross-result relationships, evidence-object completeness, magnitude context, and population/domain transport under `argument_audit`; legacy v0.1 claims audits remain validator-compatible under older contracts and immutable v0.4 receipt-schema-v0.1 packages. Every current claim family classifies `literature_facing`; a false value carries a short exclusion basis, while every true claim must join to the external literature ledger in a complete or bounded frontier. Its coverage-unit list must match the manuscript coverage inventory. In the current strict full contract, every claim occurrence binds exact or normalized text and its locator to one precise source anchor, and a claim family's anchors equal the union of its occurrence anchors. Reader rows identify their claim families and resolve back to those anchors; clean reader states also cite a source-wide scope anchor as `checked_absence`. Term rows bind first use to a precise anchor, cite direct support, and use scope-anchored absence for clean or undefined states. Only active, passed finding evidence can satisfy a reciprocal row-to-finding join. Computations and external **support records** may supplement source support but cannot replace the manuscript anchor for a manuscript claim. The `terminology_inventory` adjudicates every PDF-ingestion symbol candidate as `mapped_term`, `standard_unambiguous_notation`, `prose_noise`, `extraction_artifact`, or `non_load_bearing`, with a reason and exact occurrence anchors; non-PDF manuscript sources declare a candidate inventory or a bounded manual scope. Mapped load-bearing terms record first-use and definition anchors, or a scope-anchored definition absence when genuinely undefined. Every unsafe claim occurrence, inconsistent or unresolved reader state, undefined, inconsistent, or overloaded load-bearing term, and adverse v0.2 argument-audit state must map to an active verified finding or a structured bounded state permitted by the schema. Row-level bounded states propagate to collection and coverage status, and a bounded headline argument propagates to the central assessment.
- `evidence/figures.md`: readable per-figure inventory, visual findings, checked-clean results, and caption/text reconciliation.
- `evidence/figures.json`: schema-valid separate rendered-figure audit. New or materially refreshed audits use v0.2 rows that bind each figure to both its source-manifest row and coverage unit, plus hashed full-page and optional crop assets, visible identity evidence, pages, visual checks, correspondence status, and finding mappings. Any bounded visual, caption, correspondence, or identity state requires a structured `assessment_boundary`; an entirely unbounded row sets it to `null`. This invariant applies in quick and full mode. For PDF sources, the asset path, digest, and page must join exactly to the authenticated PDF-ingestion page-render or figure-crop record; legacy v0.1 rows remain valid. A figure-free paper must explicitly confirm that the rendered manuscript contains no figures.
- `evidence/tables.md`: readable per-table rendered audit, extraction conflicts, table-contract results, checked-clean states, and text/claim reconciliation.
- `evidence/tables.json`: schema-valid separate rendered-table audit. New or materially refreshed populated inventories use schema v0.2, with structured source bindings and immutable, role-declared render assets joined to canonical PDF-ingestion pages and table objects where applicable. Any bounded render, extraction, visual, correspondence, check, or identity state requires a structured `assessment_boundary`; an entirely unbounded row sets it to `null`. This invariant applies in quick and full mode. Version 0.1 remains readable only for backward compatibility. Every table coverage unit must map exactly once; extraction/render conflicts must be resolved from the rendered page or bounded. A table-free paper must explicitly confirm that the rendered manuscript contains no tables.
- `evidence/analytical-audit.md`: readable partition/regime, measure-algebra, assumption-implementation, derived-number, comparison-harmonization, timing/test, and availability/exclusivity ledgers.
- `evidence/analytical-audit.json`: schema-valid analytical ledgers covering all seven domains, with every adverse state mapped to an active finding and every bounded or inapplicable domain explained. New or re-finalized full reviews use analytical-audit schema v0.2. Every typed locator has a `record_ref` that appears directly in the entry's evidence references and reconciles the locator's source, locator, and representation-appropriate content to one canonical anchor, finding-evidence, computation, or external-source record. A bounded v0.2 entry or check propagates to the domain and reciprocal coverage dimension. Legacy v0.1 ledgers remain validator-compatible under older contracts and immutable v0.4 receipt-schema-v0.1 packages, and must still contain substantive source-specific evidence.
- `evidence/writing.md`: readable language-mechanics, consistency, style, and optional venue audit. Routine bibliography and citation-accuracy checking is outside the default editing comments; load-bearing source support stays substantive.
- `evidence/writing.json`: schema-valid assessment, terminology and exhibit summaries; section and redundancy audits; mechanics corrections; consistency groups; style suggestions; and optional dated evidence-backed venue candidates. Current source-derived rows cite canonical evidence and coverage units: issue occurrences bind exact or normalized text to anchors, while checked-clean mechanics and consistent terminology use scope anchors with `checked_absence`. Only active, passed finding evidence can support an adverse row. Citation accuracy and source-support verification stay in the substantive source audit, not this writing artifact. Review-contract and writing-audit versions are independent; current full runs use writing schema v0.4, while legacy packages retain their declared versions.
- `evidence/coverage.md`: deterministic rendering of source units, source-inventory closure, the activated-burden audit, applicable audit dimensions, saturation rounds, and bounded areas.
- `evidence/coverage.json`: schema-valid source/anchor-bound units, an exact audit row for every activated burden, extensible descriptive lens tags, applicable structured dimensions, finding mappings, and saturation-loop state. `second_sweep.rounds` retains every complete sweep, its candidate pass, coverage units, and new retained findings; `saturation_reached` is true only when the final round covers every non-excluded unit and active burden and adds none. Aggregate refuted, bounded, merged, and new-finding counts reconcile to `candidates.json`. Current full reviews also partition every syntax-derived Markdown/LaTeX heading or environment and every authenticated PDF page, block, table, figure, and equation in `source_inventory`; covered objects map to source-bound units and covered PDF tables/figures map reciprocally to rendered-audit rows. Duplicate, false-positive, bounded, and non-substantive outline exclusions are explicit object decisions, never silent omissions. A source-wide scope anchor can support checked absence but cannot certify granular coverage. Every internal source and anchor is covered; a code-range anchor requires a typed code unit. Supplied code, a supplied data dictionary, or a supplied-code capability state (`not_permitted`, `static_only`, or `executed`) activates a reproducibility or computational-validity burden whose audit covers all units derived from those materials. This exhaustive artifact is full-mode only; quick mode records the trigger and active burden without claiming full unit coverage. Family and branch tags are routing metadata only; activated burdens control scope.
- `evidence/sources.md`: deterministic rendering of the external-source ledger, including actual queries, verified records, supported propositions, access dates, closest-paper comparisons, and structured boundaries.
- `evidence/verification.md`: pass/fail matrix and corrections made.
- `finalization.json`: v0.4 receipt listing the exact version/mode/source gate set and hashes of every finalized canonical/generated artifact, including `paper-review.pdf`. It is produced only by the fail-closed finalizer, after per-file atomic replacement and ordinary-failure rollback; it does not assert filesystem-wide multi-file atomicity. Current full receipts use schema v0.3 and include `structured_audit_v02` plus `burden_coverage_v02`; current quick receipts use schema v0.2 and include neither. Immutable schema-v0.1 and schema-v0.2 receipts retain only their original guarantees.

Any claimed numerical mismatch must link to an auditable recomputation input/output (use `scripts/stat_recompute.py` for its supported identities) and the exact manuscript locator. Hand arithmetic is not verification. Conditional inference findings must record which reconstructed fact activated the check; absence of an irrelevant conventional diagnostic is not a finding.

## Ship gate

For contract v0.4, invoke the resolved skill Python interpreter with `"$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/finalize_review.py" review/supporting` as the only completion path, using native shell syntax on macOS, Windows, or Linux. Use `finalize_review.py --preflight review/supporting` or `validate_review.py --strict-complete review/supporting` to expose completion failures without changing status or generating reports. Finalization runs that same strict preflight first, including mode history, occurrence counts, provenance, LF-only UTF-8 canonical text, source trust, and all semantic completion conditions. Only then does it stage a completed run plus generated reports, plan, and PDF; verify source integrity, structured evidence, channel capacities, and deterministic PDF synchronization; reject unsafe paths; validate the staged package; replace each generated artifact atomically; attempt rollback on ordinary failures; and write the hashed finalization receipt last so an interruption cannot leave a receipt-valid partial package. When `run.json.prior_round` is active, it validates the reconciliation JSON and rewrites its Markdown projection before generating the report manifest and PDF, so neither can embed stale round state. When the canonical directory is named `supporting`, it then refreshes the clean parent delivery. Use `--check` and the individual generators or validator to diagnose failures, not to bypass the transaction.

Contract v0.3 uses `generate_reports.py --check`, `generate_fix_plan.py --check`, and `validate_review.py`; v0.1/v0.2 use only gates applicable to their archived layouts. Fix every error and do not deliver a nonpassing package as final. Archived v0.3 reports remain structurally valid, but current deterministic generation requires `Issue`, `Relevant text`, `Concern`, `Suggestions`, and `Status`.
