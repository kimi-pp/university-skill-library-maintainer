# Assess Refine - Cohort-Aware Normalization (0.5-point increments)

Refine rubric assessments produced by `/assess:ai-pass` by adjusting scores and
justifications based on cohort performance. All adjustments use 0.5-point
increments for clarity and rubric integrity.

## Task Overview

Normalize totals toward a median target using a nonnegative-only, additive-capped
uplift K applied in 0.5 steps per criterion, respecting per-criterion maximums
and preserving Canvas rubric validity. Optionally rewrite criterion feedback
(15-20 words in the feedback language from `metadata.feedback_language`), then
mark as reviewed and approved.

## Step 1: Locate Assessment File

If `course_id` and `assignment_id` provided:

- Look for `.claude/assessments/{{course_id}}_{{assignment_id}}_*.json` in the current repository
- Use most recent file matching that pattern

If no arguments provided:

- Check `.claude/state/assessment_state.json` for last used file
- If state file exists, use that assessment file
- If not found, search for `assessments_*.json` and use most recent
- If no files found, report error and tell user to run `/assess:setup` first

Load the assessment file using the Read tool.

## Step 2: Determine Scope and Readiness

- Default scope: `reviewed-only` (AI evaluated, not yet submitted)
- Exclude:
  - Already submitted/approved (unless `reapply=true`)
  - Already graded in Canvas (protected during setup)
  - Entries without rubric data or with invalid structures

Report counts: eligible, skipped (and reasons).

## Step 3: Compute Cohort Statistics (Before)

For the scoped set, compute:

- Total score distribution (min, Q1, median, mean, Q3, max)
- Per-criterion averages and medians
- Feasible maximum median under caps at 0.5-step precision (see below)

Display a concise summary for instructor context.

## Step 4: Normalization Policy and Parameters

Defaults unless overridden by flags:

- `policy`: `nonnegative-only` (no decreases)
- `algorithm`: `additive-capped`
- `cap_per_criterion`: `+1.0` (i.e., at most two 0.5 steps)
- `cap_total`: none
- `feedback_mode`: `rewrite`
- `approve`: `true`
- `dry_run`: `true`

Target selection:

- Median-anchored normalization to `--target` (required unless `policy=advisory-only`)
- If target missing and not advisory-only, prompt for target

0.5-step enforcement (global):

- `step_size = 0.5`
- Quantization function: `half(x) = floor(x*2)/2`

## Step 5: Solve for Uplift K (0.5-grid search)

Only for `algorithm=additive-capped`:

- Search K over the discrete grid: `{0.0, 0.5, 1.0, ..., cap_per_criterion}`
- Simulate per student:
  - For criterion c with current points Pc and max Mc:
    - `headroom_c = Mc - Pc`
    - `raw_uplift_c = min(K, cap_per_criterion, headroom_c)`
    - `uplift_c = half(raw_uplift_c)`
    - `new_points_c = min(Mc, half(Pc + uplift_c))`
  - Apply `cap_total` if provided by clamping the sum of uplifts
- Choose K whose resulting class median total is closest to target
- If target exceeds feasible median given caps and 0.5 steps:
  - Clamp to feasible maximum median and warn

Display dry-run preview:

Target median: {target} (feasible max: {feasible})
Chosen K: {K}

Totals (median): {old_med} -> {new_med}

- {crit2}: {old2} -> {new2}
- ...
(list all criteria from rubric)

Adjusted: X students
No change: Y students
Skipped: Z students (reasons)
```

## Step 6: Rating ID Remap and Validation

For each adjusted criterion:

- If `new_points_c` exactly equals a rating value, use that `rating_id`
- Else map to the highest rating whose points <= `new_points_c`; store points
- Validate rubric rules. If Canvas disallows fractional criterion points:
  - Round to the nearest allowed step
  - Warn and record rounding in the audit log

Global validations:

- All criteria present and within [0, max]
- Idempotency: if `refinement_meta` exists and `reapply=false`, abort with guidance

## Step 7: Feedback Refinement (15-20 words)

Read `metadata.language_learning`, `metadata.feedback_language`, `metadata.level`,
and `metadata.formality` from the assessment JSON.

If `feedback_mode=rewrite` or `append`, launch the appropriate agent via Task
per adjusted student to produce criterion-level comments with these constraints:

- Agent: `spanish-pedagogy-expert` if `language_learning=true`, `pedagogy-expert` if `false`
- EXACTLY 15-20 words per criterion in the feedback language
- Focus ONLY on the criterion; one main strength OR weakness
- Actionable and specific; avoid generic praise
- Do NOT mention curves, cohort, calibration, or numeric step sizes

**Prompt template (per criterion) -- Spanish (`es`)**:

```
Reescribe un comentario breve para la rubrica (15-20 palabras, espanol),
centrado SOLO en este criterio. Manten precision, especificidad y
recomendacion accionable. No menciones ajustes de calificacion ni curva.
Tono: {formality} (casual = tu, formal = usted). Nivel: {level}.

Criterio: {criterion_name}
Puntaje final: {new_points_c}/{max_c}
Descripcion breve del desempeno y rasgos observables: {signals_from_submission}
```

**Prompt template (per criterion) -- English (`en`)**:

```
Rewrite a brief rubric comment (15-20 words, English) focused ONLY on this
criterion. Be precise, specific, and actionable. Do not mention grade
adjustments or curves.
Tone: {formality} (casual = academic casual, formal = standard academic). Level: {level}.

Criterion: {criterion_name}
Final score: {new_points_c}/{max_c}
Brief description of performance and observable traits: {signals_from_submission}
```

Append mode:

- If `feedback_mode=append`, keep the original comment and add a final clause
  of 8-12 words consistent with the new score (without mentioning calibration).
  Validate that the total per criterion stays within 15-20 words if required;
  otherwise just add a concise clause.

Validation:

- Verify 15-20 words, correct language, relevance to criterion
- If validation fails, retry once; if it persists, fall back to `append` or `none` and flag for review

## Step 8: Confirm and Write

- Show a confirmation prompt. If `dry_run=true`, exit after preview
- If confirmed and `dry_run=false`:
  - For each adjusted student, use the dauber CLI via Bash:

    ```bash
    uv run dauber assess update {assessment_file_path} {user_id} \
      --rubric-json '{"criterion_id": {"points": X, "justification": "..."}, ...}' \
      --comment "Overall comment text" \
      --reviewed \
      --approved \
      --format json
    ```

    Notes:
    - Include `--approved` only if `approve=true` (default)
    - Single-quote the `--rubric-json` value to prevent shell expansion
    - If the JSON value contains single quotes, escape them appropriately

  - Write `refinement_meta` block to the assessment file via Read + modify + Write:
    - Read the current assessment JSON
    - Add a `refinement_meta` key with: policy, algorithm, step_size=0.5,
      target, K, caps, feasibility, timestamp, version, and per-student/criterion
      change summary
    - Write the updated JSON back to the file

## Step 9: Summary and State Update

Display final summary:

```
Refinement Complete
===================

Adjusted: X
No change: Y
Skipped: Z (reasons)

Totals (median): {old_med} -> {new_med}
Means: {old_mean} -> {new_mean}

Criterion averages:
- {crit1}: {old1} -> {new1}
- {crit2}: {old2} -> {new2}
- ...
(list all criteria from rubric)

Assessment File Updated:
  {assessment_file_path}

Status:
  All adjusted assessments marked as "reviewed"
  {approved_line}
```

Update `.claude/state/assessment_state.json` with refinement details to enable
auto-discovery in subsequent commands.

## Error Handling

- Missing target (and not advisory-only): prompt for `--target` or abort with guidance
- Target infeasible under caps/0.5 steps: clamp to feasible and warn
- Invalid rating map: fallback to nearest-below rating; store points; warn
- Feedback validation fails twice: fallback to `append` or `none` and flag
- Idempotency: refinement already present without `--reapply`: abort with guidance
- Assessment file not found: ask user to run `/assess:setup` and `/assess:ai-pass`

## Important Notes

- All adjustments use 0.5-point increments (`step_size=0.5`)
- Default policy prevents any score decreases (nonnegative-only)
- Per-criterion cap enforced at 0.5 precision (default +1.0)
- Total cap optional; disabled by default
- Feedback remains criterion-specific; do not reference cohort adjustments
- Safe to run in `dry_run` repeatedly; use `--reapply` for subsequent writes
- Preserves Canvas-grade safety by excluding already graded submissions

## Next Steps

- Review refined assessments as needed
- Run `/assess:submit` to post approved grades to Canvas
