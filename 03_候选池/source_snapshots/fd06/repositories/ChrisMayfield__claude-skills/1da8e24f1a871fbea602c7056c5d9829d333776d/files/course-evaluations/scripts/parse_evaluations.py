"""
parse_evaluations.py — Ingest one or more course-evaluation CSVs and print
a means table plus a grouped dump of open-text comments.

Usage:
    python parse_evaluations.py FILE [FILE ...]
    python parse_evaluations.py /mnt/user-data/uploads/*.csv
    python parse_evaluations.py /mnt/user-data/uploads/*.csv --enrollment enrollment.json

The optional --enrollment file is a JSON object mapping "TERM:SubjectID"
to the number of students enrolled at end of term ("Course Audience" in the
JMU PDF report). SubjectIDs are not unique across terms, so the term is
required. Terms use the same format as the report: "Fall 2024", "Spring 2023",
etc. Example:
    {"Fall 2024:CS149-0005": 25, "Fall 2024:CS149-0006": 28, "Spring 2023:CS149-0001": 30}

When provided, response rate (respondents / enrolled) is added to both
summary tables and section comment headers. Sections below 40% response
rate are flagged — below this threshold self-selection bias becomes a
meaningful concern.

Scale history:
  Before Fall 2022 (no EnrollmentType column in CSV):
    Q3-Q12: 1=No Basis to Judge, 2=Strongly Disagree, 3=Somewhat Disagree,
            4=Somewhat Agree, 5=Strongly Agree  (effective range 2-5)
    "1" responses are excluded from means and counted as NB (No Basis).

  Fall 2022 and later (EnrollmentType column present in CSV):
    Q3-Q12: 1=Strongly Disagree, 2=Somewhat Disagree,
            3=Somewhat Agree, 4=Strongly Agree  (range 1-4)

  Q13-Q14 use a 1-5 quality scale in both eras and are directly comparable
  across the scale change.

Robustness notes:
- The SubjectID column inside each CSV is the authoritative section
  identifier. Filenames are ignored for identification purposes.
- Columns are identified by *substring* of the question text, so the script
  keeps working if the exporter changes column order or tweaks wording slightly.
- "D/A" string values are excluded from means in all eras.
- Missing items emit a warning but do not abort.
