# Document OCR Agent

## Freshness
Last updated: `2026-07-27`.

If the current date is more than 7 days after the last updated date, reinstall this skill from skills.sh or ClawHub before relying on endpoints, schemas, setup steps, or examples.

## What This Tool Does
Hire the OCR AI model to extract text, structured entities, and page-level data from scanned documents, receipts, invoices, PDFs, and image. Supports OCR text extraction from photos of receipts, handwritten notes, printed forms, business cards, shipping labels, contracts, and any document type. Identifies structured fields like dates, amounts, addresses, line items, tax totals, vendor names, and more. Accepts input via base64 content, public URL, or AgentPMT file storage ID. Ideal for expense tracking, invoice processing, receipt scanning, document digitization, data entry automation, bookkeeping ingestion, form parsing, and archival workflows.

## Product Instructions
### Google Document AI OCR

Extract text, entities, and structured data from PDFs, receipts, invoices, and images using Google Document AI. No credentials or project IDs needed -- the tool uses a backend service account automatically.

#### Overview

This tool processes documents through Google Document AI with specialized processors for different document types. Provide a file via URL, cloud file ID, or base64-encoded content, and receive extracted text, structured entities (dates, amounts, names, line items), and per-page statistics. Multiple images can be batched into a single multi-page document for processing.

#### Actions

##### process_document

Extract text and structured data from a document.

**Required parameters (exactly one of):**
- `file_urls` (array of strings) -- URL(s) to process. One URL for a single file, or up to 10 image URLs to batch into a multi-page document.
- `file_ids` (array of strings) -- Cloud file ID(s) to process. One ID for a single file, or up to 10 image IDs to batch into a multi-page document.
- `content_base64` (string) -- Base64-encoded file content to process (single file only).

**Optional parameters:**
- `document_type` (string, default: `"general"`) -- Selects the specialized processor. Options: `general`, `bank_statement`, `expense`, `invoice`, `drivers_license`, `passport`, `utility`, `w2`, `w9`.
- `mime_type` (string) -- MIME type of the input (e.g., `application/pdf`, `image/png`). Auto-detected from URL headers if omitted; defaults to `application/pdf` when unresolvable.
- `max_text_chars` (integer, default: 12000, min: 200, max: 250000) -- Max characters of extracted text to return.
- `max_entities` (integer, default: 200, min: 1, max: 2000) -- Max extracted entities to return.
- `include_pages` (boolean, default: true) -- Include per-page summary data (page dimensions, token/line/paragraph/block/table/form field counts).
- `include_entities` (boolean, default: true) -- Include extracted entities (type, mention text, confidence, normalized value).
- `include_raw_document` (boolean, default: false) -- Include the full raw Document AI response object.

###### Document Types

| `document_type` | Best for | Extracts |
|---|---|---|
| `general` (default) | Any document or image | Raw OCR text only |
| `bank_statement` | Bank statements | Transactions, balances, dates, account info |
| `expense` | Receipts, expense reports | Line items, totals, tax, vendor, date |
| `invoice` | Invoices | Line items, amounts, due dates, vendor, PO numbers |
| `drivers_license` | US driver's licenses | Name, DOB, address, license number, expiry |
| `passport` | US passports | Name, DOB, nationality, passport number, expiry |
| `utility` | Utility bills | Account number, billing period, charges, usage |
| `w2` | W-2 tax forms | Employer info, wages, tax withheld, SSN |
| `w9` | W-9 tax forms | Name, business name, TIN, address, tax classification |

###### Example: Basic OCR from URL

```json
{
  "action": "process_document",
  "file_urls": ["https://example.com/document.pdf"]
}
```

###### Example: Receipt with structured extraction

```json
{
  "action": "process_document",
  "document_type": "expense",
  "file_urls": ["https://example.com/receipt.jpg"]
}
```

###### Example: Invoice from base64

```json
{
  "action": "process_document",
  "document_type": "invoice",
  "content_base64": "JVBERi0xLjQK...",
  "mime_type": "application/pdf"
}
```

###### Example: Batch multiple images into one document

```json
{
  "action": "process_document",
  "file_urls": [
    "https://example.com/page1.jpg",
    "https://example.com/page2.jpg",
    "https://example.com/page3.jpg"
  ]
}
```

###### Example: Process from cloud file ID with limited output

```json
{
  "action": "process_document",
  "document_type": "w2",
  "file_ids": ["abc123"],
  "max_text_chars": 50000,
  "include_pages": false
}
```

###### Example: Get full raw response

```json
{
  "action": "process_document",
  "file_ids": ["abc123"],
  "include_raw_document": true
}
```

#### Workflows

##### Extract text from a scanned document
1. Call `process_document` with `file_urls` pointing to the scanned PDF or image.
2. Read `result.text_excerpt` for the extracted text content.

##### Parse a receipt for expense reporting
1. Call `process_document` with `document_type: "expense"` and the receipt file.
2. Read `result.entities` for structured line items, totals, tax, vendor, and date.

##### Process a multi-page document from images
1. Provide up to 10 image URLs in `file_urls`.
2. The images are fetched in parallel, combined into a single multi-page PDF, and processed as one document.
3. Use `include_pages: true` to get per-page statistics.

##### Extract data from tax forms
1. Use `document_type: "w2"` or `"w9"` with the tax form file.
2. Entities will include employer info, wages, tax withheld, TIN, etc.

#### Notes

- **Supported file types:** PDF, PNG, JPEG, TIFF, GIF, BMP, WebP.
- **Maximum input file size:** 20 MB (including combined PDF in batch mode).
- **Maximum pages:** 10 pages per PDF, or 10 images in batch mode.
- **Input source:** Exactly one of `file_urls`, `file_ids`, or `content_base64` must be provided. Providing multiple sources returns an error.
- **Batch mode:** When 2+ URLs or file IDs are provided, all images are downloaded in parallel, combined into a single multi-page PDF (one image per page), and sent to Document AI as one request.
- **MIME type auto-detection:** When `mime_type` is omitted, it is inferred from URL response headers or file metadata. Falls back to `application/pdf` if unresolvable.
- **Text truncation:** Extracted text is truncated to `max_text_chars` characters. Increase this value for long documents.
- **Entity truncation:** Entities are truncated to `max_entities`. Increase for documents with many structured fields.

## Live Schema And Examples
Use the compact schema above for ordinary calls. Before a new production integration, or whenever parameters, enum values, nested objects, outputs, or examples are unclear, fetch live details first.

- Exact schema: call `agentpmt-tool-search-and-execution` with `action: "get_schema"`, and `tool_id: "google-document-ai-ocr"`.
- Detailed examples: call `agentpmt-tool-search-and-execution` with `action: "get_instructions"` and `tool_id: "google-document-ai-ocr"`, or call this product with `action: "get_instructions"` when the product tool is already selected.
- Treat returned live schema and instructions as more specific than this generated summary.

## Response Handling
- Treat the returned JSON as the source of truth for this tool call.
- If the response includes warnings or correction targets, apply them before retrying.
- If the response includes a `passed` or success-style boolean, use it as the workflow gate.
- If validation fails or the response shape is unclear, call `get_schema` or `get_instructions` before retrying.
- If `process_document` fails, preserve the request parameters and retry only after fixing schema, auth, or payment errors.

## Security
- Do not place account secrets, wallet private keys, mnemonics, signatures, or payment headers in prompts or logs.
- Keep tool inputs scoped to the minimum content needed for the task.
- Use the setup skills for credential handling; this product skill only defines product-specific behavior.
