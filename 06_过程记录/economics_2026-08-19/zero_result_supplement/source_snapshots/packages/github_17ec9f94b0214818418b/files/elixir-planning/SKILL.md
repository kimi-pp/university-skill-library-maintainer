# Elixir — Planning Skill

Architectural decisions made **before** writing implementation code. This skill sits upstream of `elixir-implementing`: planning answers *what to build and how to structure it*; implementing answers *how to type it idiomatically*.

## About this skill family

- **elixir-planning** (this) — upfront architecture: project layout, contexts, data ownership, process shape, supervision, integration mechanism, resilience, architectural style.
- **[elixir-implementing](../elixir-implementing/SKILL.md)** — the moment of writing: decision tables for constructs, idiomatic templates, anti-patterns Claude produces, TDD, testing essentials, OTP callback patterns.
- **[elixir-reviewing](../elixir-reviewing/SKILL.md)** — code inspection: review PRs, debug bugs, profile performance.

The three skills follow the skill-authoring three-modes framework. This skill leans heavily on **decision tables** (the "at the moment of designing" mode) and **process-style rules** (constraints that fire during review). Code templates appear mainly as supervision-tree shapes and context API patterns — the bulk of code templates lives in `elixir-implementing`.

**Cross-references:** subskills link to each other and to the other main skills' subskills (when they exist) via relative paths.

## How to use this skill

0. **Resuming a long-running project (M-prefix commits, `continue.md`, multi-session work)?** — **Load `long-running-projects.md` first.** It's the meta-workflow for everything below: which document records what (PLAN.md vs continue.md vs commit messages), milestone-boundary checklist (incl. Ecto-specific invariants), SSOT invariant verification, cross-session handoff quality. If the project has 5+ commits with `M\d+:` prefixes, this subskill is the primary reference; the rest of this SKILL.md becomes lookup material for specific design questions within a milestone.
1. **Starting a new project?** — Read §0 (Plan-Completeness Gate) first, then §1 (Rules), §2 (Planning Workflow), §5 (Project Layout). Walk through the decisions in sequence. Before each module, run the building-block classification (§1 rule 11b; depth in `building-blocks.md`).
2. **Adding a new feature to an existing project?** — §0 (Plan-Completeness Gate), §2 (Planning Workflow), §3 (Master Decision Table). Check §6 (do I need a new context?) and §8 (do I need a new process?). For each new module: classify as building-block / orchestrator / interface (`building-blocks.md` §3 checklist).
3. **Refactoring?** — §13 (Growing Architecture) to identify where you are, §14 (Anti-patterns) to find what to fix, §6 and §9 for context/integration rework. **For making more code property-test-friendly: load `building-blocks.md` §5 (extract vs refactor-in-place) and run Archdo `Blackbox.refactor_distance/1` to rank candidates.**
4. **Choosing how two parts of the system should talk?** — §9 (Inter-Context Communication) — the 6 mechanisms and the decision guide.
5. **Designing for failure?** — §11 (Resilience) — where circuit breakers, retries, and degradation live.
6. **About to write code?** — Verify the plan passes §0 before handing off. Load `elixir-implementing` alongside this skill.

**Scope — what this skill does NOT cover:**

- Moment-of-writing construct choice (`if`/`case`/`with`/multi-clause, Enum vs Stream, pipeline shape) → `elixir-implementing`.
- Individual library selection (which HTTP client, which JSON lib) — this skill gives the boundary shape (behaviour); the library is an implementation detail.
- Runtime debugging, performance profiling, and post-hoc review → `elixir-reviewing`.
- Long-form architecture decision records (ADRs) — the skill gives the decisions but not the prose document format.

## 0. The Plan-Completeness Gate ⛔

**Stop. A plan is not a plan until it is complete.** A plan with stubs, TODOs, "we'll figure this out later", or named-but-unresolved questions is a partial plan — and a partial plan is how production bugs get *designed in* rather than typed in.

### 0.1 The gate — a plan is complete when…

Every item below has a concrete answer before any implementation begins. If any answer is "TBD", "we'll pick later", "something like X", or "depends", the plan is incomplete. Go resolve it before coding.

**Layout & boundaries**
- [ ] Project layout chosen: single app, umbrella (name each sub-app), or poncho (§5).
- [ ] Every context named with its responsibility in one sentence (§6).
- [ ] Data ownership: every table/entity has exactly one owning context (§7.1).
- [ ] Context relationships mapped: caller → callee, and the public API function names that bridge them (§6.5).
- [ ] **For every struct that crosses a context boundary**: opacity decision is made — "opaque handle" (`@opaque` + accessor functions, like MapSet/Ecto.Query) or "public data structure" (fields documented as API, like Plug.Conn/Date). See §6.7 + [architecture-patterns.md §4.12](architecture-patterns.md). "We'll decide when callers reach in" is not an answer — once they reach in, the field shape IS public API and renaming is a breaking change.

**Processes & supervision**
- [ ] The full supervision tree drawn (ASCII, Mermaid, or list — doesn't matter which, but it must be drawn). Every supervised process named with its restart strategy (§8.3).
- [ ] Start order justified by dependency order (§8.3).
- [ ] Every GenServer/Task/Agent/`:gen_statem`/Broadway/Oban worker has a concrete child spec in mind — not "some GenServer" (§8.4).
- [ ] Registry / DynamicSupervisor decisions named if the app has dynamic processes (§8.6).

**State**
- [ ] For every piece of state: where it lives (process, ETS, DB, `:persistent_term`, cache) and why (§8.5).
- [ ] What survives a crash vs what's volatile — explicit per piece of state (§8.2).
- [ ] Multi-tenancy strategy chosen if applicable — row-level / schema-per-tenant / DB-per-tenant (§7.4).

**Communication**
- [ ] Every inter-context call path chosen from §9.8 decision guide: direct call / PubSub / Registry / GenStage / Oban / event-sourced.
- [ ] Every payload (PubSub topic, Oban job args, GenStage event) has a concrete shape — field names and types.
- [ ] Every cross-context transaction either fits in one aggregate or has a named saga/idempotency strategy (§7.2, §7.3).

**External boundaries**
- [ ] Every external dependency behind a `@callback` behaviour with the exact callback names and signatures listed (§4.4). No "we'll introduce the behaviour later."
- [ ] Config keys named for each adapter swap (test/stub vs prod) — including the exact `config :my_app, MyBoundary, ...` line.
- [ ] Every external call's failure mode classified: retry / circuit break / degrade / propagate (§11.2–11.4).
- [ ] **Every external payload format is named** (JSON / Protobuf / Avro / line-delimited / fixed binary). ETF (`:erlang.binary_to_term`) is reserved for trusted intra-cluster traffic AND only routed through `Plug.Crypto.non_executable_binary_to_term/2` (or equivalent — never bare `:erlang.binary_to_term/1`). No boundary uses `Code.eval_string`/`eval_quoted`/`compile_string` on runtime data; runtime dispatch from external input goes through a compile-time `@commands`-style registry (see `elixir-implementing` §5.10–5.11).
- [ ] **Logger.metadata propagation strategy named per async boundary.** Every Phoenix endpoint sets `Plug.RequestId` (or equivalent). Every Phoenix Channel `join/3` calls `Logger.metadata/1`. Every Oban worker's `perform/1` hydrates metadata from the job's `args`. Every `Task.async`/`Task.Supervisor.start_child` site captures parent metadata before the closure. Cross-node calls pass an explicit `TraceContext` struct. See §11.7 for the design table.
- [ ] **Every struct that carries a secret declares its `Inspect` shape at the same `defstruct` block.** No secret-bearing struct ships without `@derive {Inspect, only: [...]}` or `defimpl Inspect`. Same for `Jason.Encoder` if the struct will ever serialize. Reference: `Plug.Conn`'s `defimpl Inspect` (`lib/plug/conn.ex`) replaces `:secret_key_base` with `:...`. See `elixir-implementing` §5.13 for the templates.
- [ ] **Every response boundary (controller, channel, LiveView, GraphQL resolver, JSON view) drains stacktraces to `Logger`/`:telemetry.execute`, never returns them.** Domain errors are mapped through one error-translator module to bounded response shapes. Reference: `Phoenix.Endpoint.RenderErrors.__catch__/5` routes `__STACKTRACE__` to `instrument_render_and_send`, never the body. See `elixir-implementing` §5.14.

**Configuration**
- [ ] Every config value classified as compile-time vs runtime (§3.10, §10.2).
- [ ] runtime.exs validation strategy chosen: which env vars are required, what the error message says (§10.4, §13.X runtime.exs discipline).
- [ ] Config-accessor module named (§10.5 — see Config-module shape).

**Resilience**
- [ ] Every timeout chain cascaded: endpoint → GenServer.call → HTTP client — with numbers (§11.5).
- [ ] Every retryable operation either idempotent by design or has a dedup/idempotency key strategy (§7.3).

**Test strategy**
- [ ] For each context: which functions are unit-tested, which are property-tested, which need integration tests against the boundary (§test-strategy).
- [ ] Mock boundaries chosen (Mox for behaviours, sandbox for Repo) — not "we'll mock something."

### 0.2 Stubs, TODOs, and "later" — banned

The following phrases signal an incomplete plan. Hunt them, kill them, replace them with concrete decisions **before** handing off to implementation:

| Phrase in a plan | Replace with |
|---|---|
| "TODO: pick a library" | The library name + version, installed via `mix.exs` |
| "We'll introduce a behaviour when needed" | The `@callback` signatures, now |
| "Some kind of PubSub event" | Topic name + payload field/type list |
| "Stubbed for milestone N, wired later" | Delete the milestone split or finish the wiring now |
| "Config TBD" | The exact `config :app, Key, value` line |
| "Retry strategy to be determined" | A named strategy (bounded retries with backoff X, circuit breaker, or propagate) |
| "Validate the env var later" | The validator function and its error message |
| "Module-level TODO for error handling" | The error-return shape and who catches it |

**A plan that contains any of these phrases is not done.** Do not begin implementation. Do not commit the plan. Resolve the decision now — planning is 10× cheaper than fixing a wrong decision discovered mid-implementation.

### 0.3 Why plans fail mid-implementation

The failure mode this gate prevents:

1. A plan is written with "good-enough" placeholders.
2. Implementation begins on well-specified parts.
3. When implementation reaches a placeholder, the decision is now made under pressure (velocity, context switches, sunk-cost fallacy for what's already built).
4. The late decision either constrains an already-built piece (causing rework) or is deferred again (causing architectural drift).
5. The drifted architecture ships. Discovered in review or production.

Every TODO in a plan is a decision moved from cheap (planning) to expensive (under-pressure-mid-build).

### 0.4 Milestone splits are not placeholders

Splitting implementation into milestones (M1, M2, M3…) is fine and often correct. But the **decisions** for all milestones must be made at planning time. M3's supervision shape is decided at planning time even if M3's code is written last. "We'll design M3 when we get there" means you haven't planned.

Acceptable milestone split: "M1 wires the scaffold with the M3-decided behaviour trait; M2 adds the adapter; M3 adds the scheduler." All three shapes are known.

Unacceptable: "M1 gets us running; M2/M3 TBD." That's one milestone and a shrug.

### 0.5 The completion check before handoff

Before declaring planning done and loading `elixir-implementing`:

1. Read the plan end-to-end.
2. Grep the plan text for: `TODO`, `TBD`, `later`, `figure out`, `decide when`, `something like`, `probably`, `maybe`. Any hit → incomplete.
3. For each ✔ in §0.1, confirm it's answered with a concrete noun (a name, a type, a number, a function signature), not an adjective.
4. If the plan passes, commit it (or stamp it done) and proceed to implementation.
5. If it fails, return to the failed items and resolve them. Planning iteration is cheap.

## 1. Rules for Architecting Elixir Applications (LLM)

1. **ALWAYS start with the simplest architecture**: single Mix application + contexts + one-level supervision. Add complexity (umbrella, PubSub, GenStage, Oban, event sourcing) only when the specific problem it solves is present.
2. **ALWAYS think in three modes of content** — this skill itself follows them: rules (constrain design at review), decision tables (guide at moment of designing), BAD/GOOD (verify). For each planning decision, check the relevant decision table in §3 or §9 first.
3. **ALWAYS sketch the supervision tree before writing code.** The supervision tree IS the architecture. Start order = dependency order. Strategy encodes coupling. If you cannot draw it, you cannot build it.
4. **ALWAYS put external dependencies behind a `@callback` behaviour.** Database, HTTP, email, payment gateway, hardware — every boundary that crosses out of your app. Config picks the implementation. This gives you hexagonal architecture for free.
5. **NEVER split a modular monolith into microservices for "loose coupling" or "fault isolation"** — OTP already provides both. Only split for different languages, compliance isolation, wildly different scaling needs, or genuinely separate teams/release cycles.
6. **ALWAYS use single Mix application over umbrella** until you need hard compile-time boundaries across teams or separate deployment targets. "Feels like it's getting big" is not a reason to split.
7. **ALWAYS name modules after the domain**, not the framework (`Accounts`, `Catalog`, `Billing` — not `Controllers`, `Models`, `Services`). Scream the domain.
8. **NEVER organize code into `models/`, `services/`, `helpers/` directories.** These are anti-patterns from other ecosystems. Elixir uses contexts (boundary modules) with internal modules marked `@moduledoc false`.
9. **NEVER call `Repo` across context boundaries.** Each table is owned by exactly one context. Other contexts read through the owning context's public API.
10. **NEVER put business logic in interface modules** (controllers, LiveViews, CLI handlers, GenServer callbacks). Interfaces translate input, delegate to a context, format output. Business logic lives in pure functions inside contexts.
11. **PREFER pure functions over processes.** Use a GenServer only when you need shared mutable state, serialized access to a resource, or scheduled work. If two concepts always change together in the same flow, they belong in the same process (or no process at all).
11b. **ALWAYS classify every new module as `building_block` / `orchestrator` / `interface` BEFORE typing the moduledoc.** A building-block is a module whose every public function passes the seven-axis checklist (input closure, determinism, `@spec`, totality, side-effect freedom, errors-as-values, constrained input domain). An orchestrator is a module that connects building-blocks to side effects (DB, clock, telemetry, PubSub, external services). An interface translates IO (controller, LiveView, worker, CLI). Mixing the three in one module produces hard-to-test code and fails Archdo's `Blackbox` analyzer. **Maximize building-block coverage**: extract a building-block out of every module that mixes pure logic with side effects (see `building-blocks.md` §5 for the extract-vs-refactor-in-place decision tree). Aim for ≥ 60% of `lib/my_app/` modules to be building-blocks; ≥ 80% of pure-domain modules. **Context-level**: a context IS a building-block when every module under its namespace is a building-block; the orchestrator lives outside (typically `MyApp.Catalog.Workflow`). Cross-link: this rule is enforced by Archdo CE-54/55/56/57 (`BlackboxQuadrant`, `UntestedBuildingBlock`, `EffectLeak`, `UnguardedBuildingBlock`); the design-time discipline that makes those rules silent is in `building-blocks.md`.
12. **ALWAYS design for replaceability.** Can you swap this component's implementation without changing business logic? If not, introduce a behaviour at the boundary.
13. **ALWAYS define the aggregate consistency boundary** for domain operations. One aggregate per transaction. Cross-aggregate operations are sagas or eventual consistency, never multi-aggregate `Repo.transaction`.
14. **ALWAYS identify which operations can be retried** (Oban workers, webhook handlers, event handlers, distributed calls) and design them to be idempotent from the start.
15. **ALWAYS choose a multi-tenancy strategy before starting** if the app is tenant-aware. Retrofitting multi-tenancy is painful. Row-level (tenant_id) is the default; escalate to schema-per-tenant or DB-per-tenant only when isolation requirements demand it.
16. **NEVER place circuit breakers or retry logic in domain modules.** They belong in infrastructure adapters, wrapping external calls.
17. **ALWAYS cascade timeouts correctly**: outer > middle > inner (endpoint > GenServer.call > HTTP client). Otherwise outer timeouts fire before inner ones with meaningless errors.
18. **ALWAYS start with direct function calls** between contexts. Escalate to PubSub when you need decoupling, GenStage when you need backpressure, Oban when events must survive restarts, event sourcing when you need audit/replay. Don't pre-select the complex solution.
19. **NEVER introduce distribution (multi-node clustering) until single-node is maxed out.** `Task.async_stream`, process pools, Broadway, read replicas — exhaust these first. Distribution brings network partitions, split-brain, and eventual consistency.
20. **ALWAYS hand off to `elixir-implementing` for the actual code.** This skill decides *what to build*; the implementing skill covers *how to type it idiomatically*.
21. **ALWAYS pass the plan-completeness gate (§0) before handing off.** A plan with TODOs, "TBD", "we'll pick later", or unresolved decisions is not a plan — it's a partial plan that will force decisions under pressure mid-implementation. Every checklist item in §0.1 must have a concrete noun answer (a name, a type, a signature, a number) before implementation begins. This rule has priority over all others: an incomplete plan poisons every downstream decision.
22b. **ALWAYS pick a composition primitive at the design stage** for every multi-step operation. The four mechanisms — pipeline, railway (`with`-chain), protocol/behaviour, process — compose different kinds of things and must NOT be mixed in one operation. A "service" that's both a pipeline AND a process AND a behaviour-dispatch in the same function is undisciplined; pick one at planning time, layer the others around it (§4.7). For ok/error chains specifically: railway (`with`) is the dominant pattern — Elixir's bare `with` IS railway-oriented programming, with each `<-` as a track-switch. Plan the chain length (2–4 steps healthy, 7+ split into orchestrated phases). Split the *monadic* (`with`) and *applicative* (accumulating reduce) cases at planning time, not in implementation: monadic for sequential dependencies, applicative for independent validations whose errors should all surface. Cross-link: design-time vocabulary in §4.7; at-keyboard templates in `elixir-implementing/SKILL.md` §5.10.
22c. **ALWAYS pass capabilities (clock, random, config, secrets) as arguments** in modules destined to be building-blocks. Hidden reads (`Application.get_env`, `:rand.uniform`, `DateTime.utc_now`, `:persistent_term.get`, `:ets.lookup`) fail axis 1 of the building-block checklist (`building-blocks.md` §3.1). The Elixir form of the Reader-monad pattern is a `ctx` struct (or a few explicit args) threaded through the call chain. Behaviour-based DI is the right shape when there are 2–3 implementations chosen per environment (mailer, HTTP client); plain capability-arguments for everything else. Decide which axis-7 strategy you'll use BEFORE writing the building-block — retrofitting capability arguments to deeply-nested helpers is the painful refactor that drives "this code is hard to test" complaints (§4.7.4).
22d. **ALWAYS plan effects-as-data when a building-block must signal "this should happen"** but isn't allowed to do it. Return events as a list (`{:ok, value, [{:emit, :user_registered, %{}}]}`); the orchestrator interprets and dispatches. This is the writer-monad shape adapted to Elixir's tagged-tuple convention. Use it whenever the decision and the execution live in different layers OR when multiple potential effects need a single source of truth. Skip it for trivial single-effect cases (§4.7.3, `elixir-implementing/SKILL.md` §5.10.7).
23. **ALWAYS use battle-tested libraries for authentication, password hashing, session management, cryptography, JWTs, OAuth, secret comparison, and access tokens — NEVER hand-roll these.** Hand-rolling a security-critical primitive is an exception that requires explicit justification AND a security review; the default answer is "no." A "custom requirement" (non-standard `Authorization` scheme, custom claims shape, unusual session storage, exotic token format) is almost always a configuration parameter on a real library, NOT a reason to write your own. If you find yourself reaching for raw primitives (`Joken`, `:crypto`, hand-written plug pipelines, hand-rolled token format) ask: which library wraps these and exposes the customization I need? Almost always the answer exists. Canonical Elixir picks: `phx.gen.auth` (sessions+cookies for browser apps), Guardian (JWT for JSON APIs — `VerifyHeader`'s `scheme:` option handles non-standard headers), Ueberauth (OAuth), `bcrypt_elixir` / `argon2_elixir` (password hashing — lower rounds in `config/test.exs`, never via a behaviour-and-mock), `Plug.Crypto.secure_compare/2` (constant-time secret compare). The cost of using a library is one dep + one config block; the cost of hand-rolling is the bug you ship and don't notice.
24. **ALWAYS design observability in from the start, with explicit Logger.metadata propagation across every async boundary.** `Logger.metadata` is per-process (documented Logger behaviour). A request's `request_id` / `trace_id` / `tenant_id` does NOT travel with `Task.async`, `Task.Supervisor.start_child`, `Oban.Job`, or `:erpc` calls. Pick the propagation strategy at planning time: capture-and-restore for single-hop async, an explicit `TraceContext` struct for multi-hop / cross-node. See §11.7 for the design table; every boundary in §0.1 implicitly requires its metadata-setter and metadata-propagation strategy named.
25. **NEVER plan a system that converts external string identifiers to atoms.** Atoms are not garbage-collected; the BEAM atom table cap is ~1M. A request → atom path is a remote DoS primitive — an attacker sending a stream of unique strings permanently consumes table space, after which the node crashes and cannot recover until restart. Strings work as map keys, tuple tags, and HTTP/JSON identifiers; the only safe path from external string to atom is `String.to_existing_atom/1` against a closed compile-time allowlist. **`Ecto.Enum` is the canonical bounded-vocabulary pattern** — `field :status, Ecto.Enum, values: [:foo, :bar, :baz]` casts to atoms safely, raising on unknown values. Production libs (Phoenix, Plug, Guardian) DO use `String.to_atom` extensively — but every call site is on developer/config-time data (compiled module names, `.beam` filenames, route definitions, app-config permission keys), never on request data. The discipline is: trace the source of every string-that-becomes-atom; if it can be reached by an external request, it must go through an allowlist instead.

## 2. The Planning Workflow

Walk through this sequence before starting any Elixir project or significant feature. Answer each question; defer to the named section for detail.

### 2.1 Opening questions for a new project

| Question | Defer to |
|---|---|
| What IS the domain? Name the business concepts (the contexts). | §6 Domain Boundaries |
| What are the inputs (interfaces) and outputs (side effects / external systems)? | §4 Principles (Hexagonal), §10 Config |
| Is this a library or an application? Who owns the supervision tree? | §5.3 Library vs App |
| Single Mix app, umbrella, or poncho? | §5 Project Layout |
| Does the app have tenants? Which isolation strategy? | §7.4 Multi-Tenancy |
| What state needs to survive a crash? What's volatile? | §8 Error Kernel |
| What state lives in processes vs. in the database? | §8.5 Stateful vs Stateless |
| How will contexts communicate? Any cross-context consistency needs? | §9 Inter-Context Communication |
| What external services are involved? What happens when they fail? | §11 Resilience |
| What failure modes must the system tolerate gracefully? | §11 Graceful Degradation |

### 2.2 Opening questions for a new feature in an existing project

| Question | Defer to |
|---|---|
| Does this feature belong in an existing context, or does it warrant a new one? | §6.2 When to create a new context |
| Which context owns the data this feature operates on? | §7.1 Data Ownership |
| Does the feature cross context boundaries? If yes, how? | §9 Inter-Context Communication |
| Does it need a new process, or pure functions in an existing context? | §8.1 Do you need a process? |
| Is there a retry / failure path? Is the operation idempotent? | §7.3 Idempotency |
| Does the feature need to degrade gracefully when a dependency is down? | §11.4 Graceful Degradation |

### 2.3 Opening questions when refactoring

| Question | Defer to |
|---|---|
| Which growth stage is this app at? | §13 Growing Architecture |
| Are there contexts doing more than one job (mixed responsibilities)? | §6.2 When to split |
| Are there cross-context Repo calls, or contexts reaching into each other's internals? | §7.1 Data Ownership |
| Are there GenServers doing CRUD-y stuff that could be pure functions? | §8.1 Do you need a process? §14 Anti-Patterns |
| Is the supervision tree expressing the architecture, or is it flat? | §8.3 Supervision as Architecture |
| Are there processes simulating objects (agent-per-entity)? | §14 "Simulating Objects with Processes" |

### 2.4 The "what's needed now vs later" test

Elixir architecture is **additive**. The progression is:

```
Phase 0 (MVP):     Contexts + supervision + one behaviour (Repo)
Phase 1:           + PubSub for UI updates / decoupling
Phase 2:           + Oban for guaranteed async work
Phase 3:           + GenStage / Broadway for backpressured pipelines
Phase 4:           + Event sourcing for audit / replay (only if needed)
Phase 5:           + Distributed architecture (only if single-node maxed)
```

**Never adopt a phase before its triggering problem appears.** Each phase adds complexity; unjustified complexity compounds.

## 3. Master "Planning Decision" Table

This is the spine of the skill. Every major architectural question maps to a row. Find your question in the left column; the right columns show the decision and the defer-to section.

### 3.1 Project layout

| Question | Answer | Details |
|---|---|---|
| New project, one team, one deployable | Single Mix application + contexts | §5.1 |
| New project, multiple teams with hard boundaries | Umbrella | §5.2 |
| New project, cleanly separate runtime deployables (central API + edge worker + shared payload lib) | Umbrella with one app per deployable + a shared `*_wire` app for cross-deploy types | §5.2 |

## 4. Architectural Principles

Eleven principles that govern every structural decision. When in doubt, return here.

> **Depth:** [architecture-patterns.md](architecture-patterns.md) — full walkthrough of each architectural style (hexagonal, layered, modular monolith, event-driven, CQRS) with worked examples, common mistakes, and migration paths.

### 4.1 The eleven principles

| # | Principle | Core idea |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Dependencies point inward** | Interface→Domain→ nothing. Infrastructure implements contracts the Domain defines. Domain must never alias/import framework modules. |
| 2 | **Behaviours are ports, implementations are adapters** | Every external dependency (DB, API, email, hardware) sits behind a `@callback` behaviour the domain owns. Config picks the impl. Ecto.Adapter + Postgres/MySQL is the canonical example. |
| 3 | **Side effects live in infrastructure** | The ideal. In practice, Phoenix contexts intentionally mix Repo into domain-adjacent modules (`mix phx.gen.context` does this). Full separation is event-sourcing territory. For non-Repo side effects (HTTP, email, I/O), apply the boundary. |
| 4 | **The supervision tree IS the architecture** | Start order = dependency order. Strategy encodes coupling. Not fault-tolerance plumbing — a structural expression of what-depends-on-what. |
| 5 | **Error kernel design** | Stable, critical-state processes near the top; volatile workers below. A worker crash must not topple critical state. Design for recovery, not prevention. |
| 6 | **Pure core, impure shell** | GenServers own process mechanics; pure functions own domain logic. Test domain logic without processes. For complex dispatch, use the instructions pattern (§8.7). |
| 7 | **One reason to change per boundary module** | If a module changes for both business rules AND DB schema reasons, it has too many responsibilities. Boundary modules are public-API facades; internals take `@moduledoc false`. |
| 8 | **Design for replaceability** | Can you swap a component's implementation without touching business logic? If not, add a behaviour at the boundary. |
| 9 | **Small, focused behaviours** | Prefer `Chargeable` + `Refundable` + `Subscribable` over one 20-callback `PaymentGateway`. Clients shouldn't depend on callbacks they don't use. |
| 10 | **The testability test** | If you can't test a business rule without a DB, web server, or external service, the architecture has a boundary problem. Pure domain logic → plain ExUnit, no Repo, no HTTP, no processes. |
| 11 | **Scream the domain** | Top-level module names reflect business (`Accounts`, `Catalog`, `Billing`) not technical (`Controllers`, `Services`, `Helpers`). A new dev should read the module tree and understand what the system does. |

> **Depth:** [architecture-patterns.md](architecture-patterns.md) walks each principle with worked examples, failure modes, and migration patterns for retrofitting onto existing code.

### 4.2 The Actor Model — what BEAM gives you for free

| BEAM property | What it means | What it gives you |
|---|---|---|
| **Isolated state** | Each process has its own heap and GC | No locks, mutexes, or race conditions on shared data |
| **Message passing** | Processes communicate only by sending messages | All inter-process data is immutable by design (copied) |
| **Shared nothing** | No shared memory between processes | Scales linearly across cores; GC is per-process |
| **Location transparent** | `send(pid, msg)` identical for local and remote pids | Distribution is a config choice, not a code change |
| **Fail independently** | One process crash doesn't affect others | Supervision handles recovery; system continues |

### 4.3 Message passing semantics

| Guarantee | Meaning | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| **At-most-once** | Messages can be lost if receiver crashes before processing | Application handles reliability (idempotency, retries) |
| **Ordering within pair** | Messages from A→B arrive in send order | A→B and C→B may interleave arbitrarily |
| **No exactly-once** | BEAM provides no built-in exactly-once delivery | Design for at-least-once: make operations idempotent |
| **`call` semantics** | Caller gets `{:reply, _}` OR an exit | Caller always knows the outcome |

**Rule:** Use `GenServer.call` when you need to know the outcome. Use `cast` or `send` only when fire-and-forget is acceptable. Across node boundaries, ALWAYS use `call` — network partitions make `cast` unreliable.

### 4.4 Hexagonal architecture in Elixir

| Hexagonal concept | Elixir implementation |
|---|---|
| Port (interface) | `@callback` behaviour |
| Adapter (implementation) | Module implementing the behaviour |
| Domain core | Context modules with pure functions |
| Driving adapter (input) | Phoenix controllers, LiveView, CLI, API |
| Driven adapter (output) | Repo, HTTP clients, email, file I/O, hardware |
| Configuration | `Application.compile_env` (app) or `Application.get_env` (library) picks adapter |

Elixir gets hexagonal architecture **for free** via behaviours. You do not need a framework.

### 4.5 Layered architecture

The standard three layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Interface (driving adapters)        │ ← Phoenix, CLI, LiveView, GraphQL
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Domain (contexts, pure logic)       │ ← Accounts, Catalog, Orders, ...
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Infrastructure (driven adapters)    │ ← Repo, HTTP clients, Mailer, Cache
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Dependencies point downward (Interface → Domain → Infrastructure).
Never upward. Never sideways (Interface → Infrastructure).
```

- **Interface layer** translates input, delegates to domain, formats output. No business logic.
- **Domain layer** contains contexts with entities (pure data + invariants) and use cases (orchestration). No framework references.
- **Infrastructure layer** implements behaviours defined by domain. Each external dependency has an adapter.

### 4.6 Polymorphism — Behaviours vs Protocols

Elixir has **two** polymorphism mechanisms. Choosing the right one shapes every boundary in your system.

> **Depth:** [architecture-patterns.md](architecture-patterns.md) §4.7–4.11 — full decision table, protocol-on-struct strategy pattern, behaviour design guidelines, contract evolution, "behaviour spam" anti-pattern. **Implementation templates** (`defprotocol`, `defimpl`, `@derive`, `@callback`, `@impl`, `use`/`defoverridable`, Mox): [../elixir-implementing/idioms-reference.md](../elixir-implementing/idioms-reference.md) §Protocols + §Behaviours.

**The fundamental difference:**

| Mechanism | Dispatches on | Swapped by | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Behaviour** | The **module** the caller invokes | Config, explicit argument | `Plug`, `GenServer`, `MyApp.Storage` → `Redis` / `Mock` |
| **Protocol** | The **data type** of the first argument | Adding a `defimpl` for a new type | `Enumerable`, `Jason.Encoder`, `String.Chars` |

**Decision — which to use?**

| When you need to… | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Swap implementation per environment (real vs test) | **Behaviour** | Config chooses the module; Mox generates a test double |
| Pluggable strategies / external adapters (hexagonal ports) | **Behaviour** | The strategy IS a module, not data |
| Multiple data types share a method (`encode/1`, `render/1`) | **Protocol** | Dispatch comes from the value's type |
| Extend a framework (implement `GenServer`, `Plug`, `Supervisor`) | **Behaviour** | Framework defines the contract |
| Add support for a new type to an API you don't own | **Protocol** | `defimpl Jason.Encoder, for: MyStruct` without touching Jason |
| Separate ports from adapters (hexagonal) | **Behaviour** | Port = behaviour, adapter = module implementing it |
| Offer `@derive` on user structs | **Protocol** | Only protocols support `@derive` |
| Runtime-pluggable behaviour per entity (not per env) | **Protocol on struct** (see below) | Each struct carries its own implementation |
| Fail loudly when no implementation matches | **Protocol without fallback** | `Enumerable`, `Collectable` |
| Single implementation today, "just in case" abstraction | **Neither — plain module** | Introduce when a real second implementation exists |

**"Plain module" is the default.** Introducing either mechanism has costs (cognitive, consolidation, test fixtures). Add the indirection when a real second implementation or test double exists — not speculatively.

**Protocol-on-struct — the strategy/plugin pattern (AshAuthentication):**

When you want runtime-pluggable behaviour per entity (not per environment), neither plain behaviour nor plain protocol fits cleanly. The pattern: each strategy is a **struct**; a protocol is implemented for each strategy struct; the caller dispatches on the struct value.

```elixir
defprotocol MyApp.AuthStrategy do
  def authenticate(strategy, credentials)
end

defmodule MyApp.Strategies.Password do
  defstruct [:hash_algorithm, :min_length]
  defimpl MyApp.AuthStrategy do
    def authenticate(%{hash_algorithm: alg}, %{password: p}), do: ...
  end
end

# Strategies are configured with their own state; dispatch on struct value
for s <- Application.fetch_env!(:my_app, :strategies) do
  MyApp.AuthStrategy.authenticate(s, creds)
end
```

**Why this beats plain behaviour:** strategies can be configured with state (hash algorithm, OAuth credentials) that travels with the dispatch — no separate registry needed.
**When to reach for it:** Ash extension systems, plugin architectures, per-tenant pluggable behaviour.

**Behaviour design quick rules:**

- **Narrow the surface** — the behaviour expresses what the *domain* needs, not what the library offers.
- **Return domain types**, not library types — translate `%Stripe.Charge{}` to `%Payment{}` in the adapter.
- **`@optional_callbacks` sparingly** — each one is a `function_exported?` check at the call site.
- **Version via new modules**, not by adding required callbacks to existing behaviours (breaking change).

See `architecture-patterns.md` §4.7–4.11 for the full treatment.

### 4.7 Composition — the design vocabulary

Composition is *the* central concern of functional design: small pieces snap together because their inputs and outputs match. Elixir gives you four composition mechanisms, each with a distinct shape — and the choice of which to use is a *design-time* decision, not a "we'll see what fits" decision. Pick at planning time; commit at module-creation time.

**Building-blocks are the foundation; composition is the payoff.** Every composition primitive in this section delivers its full value ONLY when applied to building-blocks (`building-blocks.md`):

- **Railway / `with`-chain** composes functions that return `{:ok, _}` / `{:error, _}` — that's axis 6 (errors-as-values) of the building-block checklist.
- **`Result.map` / functor** composes pure transforms over success values — axes 1–6 (purity, determinism, no side effects).
- **Applicative validation** accumulates errors from independent pure validators — axes 1, 5, 6.
- **Effects-as-data** is the *only* honest way for a building-block to communicate "this should happen" without doing it (axis 5).
- **Capability passing** IS axis 1 (input closure) restated as a composition pattern — the values needed from outside flow in as arguments.
- **Smart constructors** push validation to one place and grant axis 7 (input guard) automatically to every downstream consumer.
- **Subject-position discipline** is what makes building-block functions snap into pipelines without contortion.

Composition built on top of impure code is a half-payoff: you can wire functions together, but you can't property-test the chain, you can't memoize, and you can't reason locally. Composition built on top of building-blocks gives you all three. **The slogan: build building-blocks, then COMPOSE them.**

The composition × building-block axes matrix:

| Composition primitive | Depends on building-block axes | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Railway / `with`-chain | 6 (errors-as-values) | Steps must return tuples, never raise |
| `Result.map` / functor | 1, 5, 6 | The mapped function must be pure and total |
| Applicative validation | 1, 5, 6 | Validators must be pure to combine cleanly |
| Effects-as-data | 5 (no side effects in the producer) | The whole pattern exists to keep the producer pure |
| Capability passing | 1 (input closure) | This IS the technique that satisfies axis 1 |
| Smart constructors | 7 (input guard, downstream) | Push axis-7 from N consumers to 1 constructor |
| Pipeline (`\|>`) | (subject-first discipline) | Every step's first arg = data; orthogonal to purity but required for chaining |
| Stream (lazy pipeline) | 1, 5 | Laziness preserves purity ONLY if the elements + transforms are pure; an impure step inside a Stream chain runs at materialization time, not at chain-construction time — the bug is harder to trace |
| Threading-builder | (subject-first discipline; axis-orthogonal otherwise) | `Multi`/`Conn`/`Socket` subjects are intrinsically effectful but the SHAPE is composable; re-binding instead of piping breaks the shape |
| Lens / `update_in` | 5 (the update must be pure) | Side-effect mid-update breaks the lens algebra |
| Reduce-as-fold | 1, 5, 6 | The reducer fn must be pure; its accumulator is the fold's state |
| Memoization | 1, 2 (input closure + determinism) | Caching impure or non-deterministic functions LIES — the cache returns a stale or wrong value |
| Encoder/decoder pair | 1, 2, 5, 6 | Round-trip property `decode(encode(x)) == x` requires deterministic, pure pair |
| Phantom / branded types | 7 (input guard at construction) | The validated state is encoded in the type — downstream consumers inherit axis-7 for free |

#### 4.7.1 The six composition mechanisms

| Mechanism | Composes... | Mechanism in Elixir |
|---|---|---|
| **Pipeline** (`\|>`) | Eager data transformations | Subject-first functions threaded through `\|>` (subject TYPE may change at each step) |
| **Stream** | Lazy / I/O-sourced / unbounded data transformations | `Stream.*` chain ending in one terminal `Enum.*` — same shape as a pipeline but lazy |
| **Threading-builder** | A subject that ACCUMULATES state across steps (subject type doesn't change) | `Multi.new() \|> Multi.insert() \|> Multi.update() \|> Repo.transaction()`; `socket \|> assign() \|> stream() \|> push_event()`; `Plug.Conn` chains |
| **Railway / `with`-chain** | Sequential ok/error operations | `with {:ok, _} <- f(), {:ok, _} <- g(_)` — Elixir's adaptation of railway-oriented programming |
| **Protocol / Behaviour** | Type or module dispatch | `defprotocol` (data-type dispatch), `@callback` (module-identity dispatch) |
| **Process / GenServer** | Stateful or concurrent collaborators | Supervised processes; messages are the protocol |

The first four compose **pure values**; the last two compose **modules / processes**. Building-blocks (see `building-blocks.md`) max-out the value-composition layer; orchestrators connect that layer to the module/process layer.

**Distinguishing the four value-composition shapes:**

- **Pipeline** — subject type CHANGES at each step (`String.t()` → `[String.t()]` → `Map.t()`). Each step is a transformation.
- **Stream** — same shape as pipeline but every intermediate is lazy. Use when source is `File.stream!`, `Repo.stream`, `IO.stream`, `Stream.resource/3`, or when collection size is unknown / unbounded. Materialize with one terminal `Enum.*` at the end.
- **Threading-builder** — subject type is FIXED (always `Multi.t()`, always `Plug.Conn.t()`, always `Phoenix.LiveView.Socket.t()`); each step ENRICHES the subject with more state. Failure mode is re-binding (`x = step1(); x = step2(x)`) instead of piping.
- **Railway** — subject is wrapped in `{:ok, _}`/`{:error, _}`; failure short-circuits. Each step is a sequential dependency.

#### 4.7.2 Railway-Oriented Programming, adapted to Elixir's `with`

Wlaschin's railway model: every step is a switch in a two-track railway — success-track on top, failure-track on bottom. A function on the success-track returns either a success value (continue on top) or an error (drop to bottom, skip the rest). **Elixir's `with` IS the railway** — bare `with` (no `else`) propagates errors exactly as the railway predicts: a non-matching `<-` step's value becomes the whole expression's value.

**Connection to building-blocks:** the railway only works because each step returns ok/error tuples and never raises — that's axis 6 of the building-block checklist. Plan the railway in the building-block layer (typically `MyApp.Catalog`); plan the orchestrator that drives it in `MyApp.Catalog.Workflow`. The orchestrator is allowed to wrap impure steps (Repo, HTTP, mailer) in the same `with` chain, but the impure steps must themselves return ok/error — the orchestrator's job is to keep the railway shape consistent across pure and impure stops.

**Plan a railway when:** you have 2+ ok/error steps where each step depends on the previous step's value (extract from a request, validate, transform, persist). Each `<-` is one step on the railway.

**Plan an accumulating reduce instead when:** the steps are *independent* and the user wants to see ALL errors (form validation across fields, batch import, parallel HTTP fetches). `with` short-circuits on first error — wrong UX for these.

The split is between **monadic** (sequential, short-circuit) and **applicative** (independent, accumulate) — the same FP distinction, mapped to Elixir's two natural shapes (`with` vs `Enum.reduce`). See `elixir-implementing/SKILL.md` §5.10.1–§5.10.6 for the templates.

#### 4.7.3 Effects-as-data — the writer pattern, adapted to Elixir

A building-block can't emit `Logger`, `Repo`, `PubSub`, or `:telemetry` calls (axis 5 of the building-block checklist). But the building-block KNOWS what should happen. Plan the return shape to carry the effects as data — `{:ok, value, [events]}` — and let the orchestrator interpret. This is the writer-monad pattern, naturally expressed in Elixir's tagged-tuple convention without any library.

When to plan for effects-as-data:
- The decision (what should happen) and the execution (do it) live in different layers — typical for any building-block + orchestrator split
- Multiple potential effects (telemetry + email + audit-log entry) need a single source of truth on which fired
- You want the building-block property-tested without effect mocks

When NOT to:
- Exactly one effect, transactional — the orchestrator's `with` chain handles it inline
- Effects vary so wildly per call that the events-list shape is harder to reason about than direct calls

#### 4.7.4 Capability passing — Reader-monad shape, adapted to Elixir

Anything a building-block needs from the environment — `now()`, random, configuration, secrets — comes in as an *argument*. The orchestrator resolves the capability at call time. For multiple capabilities, bundle them in a `ctx` struct (`%MyApp.Clock.Ctx{}`) — that struct IS a Reader-monad value being threaded through the call chain.

**Capability passing is non-negotiable for axis 1 (input closure)** of the building-block checklist. A building-block that calls `DateTime.utc_now/0` directly fails the checklist; one that takes `now :: DateTime.t()` as an argument and uses it passes.

Behaviour-based DI (config-pick the impl per environment) is a degenerate form of capability passing: useful for 2–3 implementations chosen at boot (mailer, HTTP client), not for 5+ runtime-varying capabilities. Use it sparingly; prefer plain capability-arguments for runtime variation.

#### 4.7.5 Smart constructors — opacity makes axis 7 free

A struct with an `@opaque` type and a validating `new/1` constructor is the upstream trick that simplifies axis 7 (input guard) for every downstream function. Once a `%Email{}` exists, you know it's valid; downstream functions taking `%Email{}` don't need their own validation. The constructor is the *only* place that validation lives — every consumer is automatically input-guarded by the type.

Plan opacity at the design stage (`architecture-patterns.md` §4.12) for any value that has invariants: `%Email{}`, `%Slug{}`, `%MonetaryAmount{}`, `%PhoneNumber{}`, `%TenantId{}`. The cost is one constructor + accessor function per struct; the payoff is propagated input-safety across every function that takes that type.

**Bidirectional pairs — every encoder ships its decoder.** Smart constructors are one half of a bidirectional pair. The other half is the inverse: render the value to a serialized form, then parse it back. The round-trip property `parse(render(x)) == {:ok, x}` is property-test gold. Stdlib examples: `Date.to_iso8601/1` + `Date.from_iso8601/1`, `URI.to_string/1` + `URI.parse/1`, `Jason.encode/1` + `Jason.decode/1`. When you ship a value type with `new/1`, also ship `to_serialized/1` (and the reverse parser) — and add a property test that asserts the round-trip. See `architecture-patterns.md` §4.12.3 for the `Ecto.Type` `dump`/`load` mechanics that follow the same pattern.

**When to plan a phantom/branded type instead** — if the value has multiple lifecycle states (verified vs. unverified email, sealed vs. open envelope, draft vs. published document) and downstream consumers should ONLY accept the validated state, plan two structs (`%UnverifiedEmail{}` returned from raw input, `%Email{}` returned from `verify/1`). Functions take the state-bearing type they require; callers can't accidentally feed an unverified value into a verified-only function. See `architecture-patterns.md` §4.12.8 for the pattern.

#### 4.7.6 Decision summary — given a problem, which composition primitive

| Situation | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Sequential transformation of one value | Pipeline (`\|>`) |
| Sequential ok/error operations, one fails → stop | Railway / `with`-chain (§5.10.1) |
| Independent validations, accumulate failures | Accumulating reduce (§5.10.6) |
| One-step transform on a Result | `with {:ok, v} <- f(), do: {:ok, fn.(v)}` (§5.10.5) |
| Distinguish which step failed | Tagged-tuple `with` (§5.10.3) |
| Build a value once, reuse across functions | Smart constructor (`@opaque` + `new/1`) (§4.12 in architecture-patterns) |
| Communicate "this should happen" without doing it | Return events list `{:ok, value, [events]}` (§5.10.7) |
| Read clock / random / config in pure code | Capability argument (§5.10.8) |
| Update a deeply nested field | `update_in` / `put_in` with Access path (§5.10.9) |
| Dispatch on data type | Protocol |
| Dispatch on module identity, swap per env | Behaviour + Application config |
| Coordinate stateful / concurrent collaborators | Supervised process (GenServer / `:gen_statem`) |

Section references in this row are to `elixir-implementing/SKILL.md` §5.10 — that's where the at-keyboard templates live.

#### 4.7.7 Composability density — a metric, not a rule

For each building-block module, ask: *how many distinct callers compose with it through its first-arg position?* High density (≥ 3 callers using it via pipelines) means the module is delivering on the composition promise; low density means it's a building-block in shape but not in use. Use this metric to rank which building-blocks to property-test first — high-density blocks have the most leverage. This is one of Archdo's planned metrics (`Archdo.Blackbox.composability_density/2`).

#### 4.7.8 Memoization is a building-block payoff

A pure deterministic function (axes 1 + 2 of the building-block checklist) can be memoized safely: same input → same output → caching the output is correct. **An impure or non-deterministic function CANNOT be memoized without lying** — the cache returns a stale or wrong value. Memoization is therefore a payoff that *only* building-blocks unlock; any module that fails axis 1 or 2 is structurally ineligible.

**Plan memoization at the design stage when:**
- The building-block function is on a hot path (called every request, every event, every iteration of a loop).
- The function is genuinely expensive: regex compilation, ISO 8601 parsing, hash computation, large-data serialization.
- Inputs have low cardinality OR high reuse (the same arguments repeat often enough that caching pays off).

**Two storage shapes to choose from:**

| Storage | Use when | Read cost | Write cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ETS** (`:public, read_concurrency: true`) | Cache changes during runtime; concurrent readers and writers | O(1) | O(1) |
| **`:persistent_term`** | Read-mostly lookup table; written ONCE at boot or rarely | O(1), faster than ETS | O(N) — copies across all processes |

**`:persistent_term` is NEVER appropriate for hot-path writes** — every `put` triggers a global GC sweep proportional to the number of processes. Use it for boot-time tables (config, compiled regex, lookup maps); use ETS for everything else.

**Architectural placement:** the cache lives in the orchestrator layer, not the building-block. The building-block stays pure; the orchestrator wraps it with a `cache_get` call:

```elixir
# Building-block (pure):
defmodule MyApp.Tokens do
  @spec sign(payload :: map(), secret :: String.t()) :: String.t()
  def sign(payload, secret), do: # ... HMAC + Base64
end

# Orchestrator with ETS-backed cache:
defmodule MyApp.Tokens.Cache do
  def signed(payload, secret) do
    key = {payload, secret}
    case :ets.lookup(:token_cache, key) do
      [{^key, signed}] -> signed
      [] ->
        signed = MyApp.Tokens.sign(payload, secret)
        :ets.insert(:token_cache, {key, signed})
        signed
    end
  end
end
```

The building-block is property-testable without the cache; the cache is integration-testable with the building-block as a real dependency. Both layers are independently swappable.

**See also:** `elixir-implementing/SKILL.md` §9.2 (ETS templates), §9.2.2 (`:persistent_term` hot-path config). The Archdo rule `5.75 MemoizeOpportunity` (planned in M-fp-C4) flags building-block functions with expensive calls but no cache in scope.

## 5. Project Layout

First decision in any new Elixir project: how to lay it out.

> **Depth:** [architecture-patterns.md](architecture-patterns.md) §3 — modular monolith deep dive, §5 — layered architecture.

### 5.1 Single Mix application — the default

One `lib/` tree, organized by domain boundaries. This works for Phoenix web apps, Nerves firmware, CLI tools, and pure OTP services alike.

```
my_app/
├── lib/
│   ├── my_app/                   # Domain layer
│   │   ├── application.ex        # Supervision tree
│   │   ├── repo.ex               # Ecto Repo
│   │   ├── accounts.ex           # Context — public API
│   │   ├── accounts/
│   │   │   ├── user.ex           # Schema (internal — @moduledoc false)
│   │   │   └── token.ex
│   │   ├── catalog.ex
│   │   ├── catalog/
│   │   │   ├── product.ex
│   │   │   └── category.ex
│   │   ├── mailer.ex             # Behaviour
│   │   └── mailer/
│   │       └── swoosh.ex         # Adapter
│   └── my_app_web/               # Interface layer (Phoenix)
│       ├── endpoint.ex
│       ├── router.ex
│       ├── controllers/
│       ├── live/
│       └── components/
├── config/
│   ├── config.exs
│   ├── dev.exs
│   ├── test.exs
│   └── runtime.exs
├── test/
└── mix.exs
```

**When it's sufficient:** Most applications. Contexts provide domain boundaries without the overhead of multiple apps. Scale by adding contexts, not apps.

**How to grow it:** Add new context files (`lib/my_app/orders.ex`) and their internal modules (`lib/my_app/orders/*.ex`). No restructuring needed until you hit a team-boundary or deployment-boundary problem.

### 5.2 Umbrella project — multiple apps, shared config

Multiple OTP applications in one repository sharing build artifacts, deps, and config:

```
my_platform/                        # Root — no code here
├── apps/
│   ├── core/                       # Domain logic
│   │   ├── lib/core/
│   │   │   ├── accounts.ex
│   │   │   └── billing.ex
│   │   └── mix.exs
│   ├── core_web/                   # Phoenix web layer
│   │   ├── lib/core_web/
│   │   │   ├── endpoint.ex
│   │   │   └── router.ex
│   │   └── mix.exs                 # deps: [{:core, in_umbrella: true}]
│   └── worker/                     # Background processing
│       └── mix.exs                 # deps: [{:core, in_umbrella: true}]
├── config/config.exs               # Shared config for ALL apps
├── mix.exs                         # apps_path: "apps"
└── mix.lock                        # Single lockfile
```

**Root `mix.exs`:**

```elixir
defmodule MyPlatform.MixProject do
  use Mix.Project
  def project, do: [apps_path: "apps", version: "0.1.0", deps: deps()]
  defp deps, do: []   # Shared deps go here; app-specific deps in child mix.exs
end
```

**Child `mix.exs`:**

```elixir
defmodule Core.MixProject do
  use Mix.Project
  def project do
    [
      app: :core,
      build_path: "../../_build",
      config_path: "../../config/config.exs",
      deps_path: "../../deps",
      lockfile: "../../mix.lock",
      deps: [{:ecto, "~> 3.12"}]     # App-specific deps
    ]
  end
end
```

**Key properties:**

- Single `mix test` runs all apps; `mix test --app core` runs one
- Single `config/config.exs` for all apps — shared configuration
- Sibling deps via `in_umbrella: true`
- All apps share the same dependency versions (no version conflicts)
- `mix new my_platform --umbrella` scaffolds the structure

**When umbrella wins:** Multiple teams working on distinct subsystems. Separate deployment targets (web vs worker vs API). Hard compile-time module boundaries.

**When umbrella loses:** Single team, single deploy. The split creates maintenance overhead with little benefit. Stay with single Mix app + contexts.

### 5.3 Poncho project — full independence

Independent Mix projects in one repository linked by path dependencies:

```
my_platform/
├── core/                           # Independent project
│   ├── lib/core/
│   ├── config/config.exs           # Own config
│   ├── mix.exs
│   └── mix.lock
├── web/
│   └── mix.exs                     # deps: [{:core, path: "../core"}]
└── worker/
    └── mix.exs                     # deps: [{:core, path: "../core"}]
```

**Differences from umbrella:**

- Each app has its own config, deps, and lockfile
- Different apps can use different dep versions
- No shared build directory — fully independent compilation
- No `mix test` from root — test each app separately

**When poncho wins:** Apps need different dependency versions. Apps have different release cycles. Migrating toward fully independent Hex packages. Teams need complete autonomy.

### 5.4 Library vs application architecture

**A library is code you publish for others to consume** (Hex package, path dep in another project). **An application is code you deploy as a running system** (Mix release).

| Dimension | Application | Library |
|---|---|---|
| Owns supervision tree | Yes | No — added as child to someone else's tree |
| Configuration | `Application.get_env` in `runtime.exs`, `Application.compile_env` in `config.exs` | Accepts config via function arguments; optionally `Application.get_env` at runtime only |
| Framework dependencies | Can depend on Phoenix/Ecto/etc. | Framework-agnostic, or optional integration |
| Behaviour for swap | Config-driven | Consumer passes implementation module |
| Global state | Named GenServers, `Application.ensure_started` | Accepts registry/PubSub refs as options |

**Library rules:**

1. **Never use `Application.compile_env` in a library** — consumers can't reconfigure after compilation. Use `Application.get_env` at runtime or accept config as arguments.
2. **Never hardcode global names** — `name: __MODULE__` means only one instance can run. Accept a name option.
3. **Minimize dependencies** — each dep is a liability for your consumers.
4. **Define extension via behaviours** — let consumers customize, don't hardcode implementations.
5. **Ship a default implementation** — a useful library works out of the box AND can be customized.

```elixir
# BAD — library assumes it owns the world
defmodule MyLib.Worker do
  use GenServer
  def start_link(_) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, Application.get_env(:my_lib, :config), name: __MODULE__)
    #                                                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ hardcoded
  end
end

# GOOD — library is a guest in someone else's application
defmodule MyLib.Worker do
  use GenServer
  def start_link(opts) do
    {config, server_opts} = Keyword.split(opts, [:buffer_size, :flush_interval])
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, config, server_opts)
  end

  def child_spec(opts) do
    %{id: opts[:id] || __MODULE__, start: {__MODULE__, :start_link, [opts]}}
  end
end
```

### 5.5 Layout decision guide

| Signal | Layout |
|---|---|
| Single team, one deployable | Single Mix app + contexts |
| Multiple teams, hard compile-time boundaries | Umbrella |
| Apps need different dep versions | Poncho |
| Extracting a library for Hex | Poncho → eventual Hex package |
| "Should I split?" uncertainty | **Don't split.** Use contexts inside a single app. |
| Feels like it's getting big | **Don't split.** Add contexts. |
| Code genuinely can't compile together | Umbrella or poncho (rare — usually indicates broken contexts) |

**Rule:** prefer single app + contexts until a concrete, non-ergonomic reason forces a split. Splitting is the hardest architectural decision to reverse.

---

## 6. Domain Boundaries (Contexts)

A context is a module that groups related functionality behind a public API. Phoenix calls them "contexts"; the pattern is framework-agnostic and works in any Elixir application. **The boundary module is the only public entry point. Internal modules are hidden behind `@moduledoc false`.**

> **Depth:** [data-ownership-deep.md](data-ownership-deep.md) — aggregate design, context boundaries, multi-tenancy. [architecture-patterns.md](architecture-patterns.md) §3.4 — context design within a modular monolith.

### 6.1 Entities vs use cases

Domain code has two kinds of logic. Distinguish them when designing.

**Entities** — core business rules that exist regardless of the application. Pure data structures with functions that enforce invariants:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Orders.Order do
  @moduledoc false
  defstruct [:id, :items, :status, :total]

  def calculate_total(%__MODULE__{items: items}) do
    Enum.reduce(items, Decimal.new(0), &Decimal.add(&2, &1.subtotal))
  end

  def can_cancel?(%__MODULE__{status: status}), do: status in [:pending, :confirmed]
end
```

**Use cases** — application-specific orchestration. Each public function in a context module is a use case. It coordinates entities, calls infrastructure through behaviours, returns `{:ok, _} | {:error, _}`:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Orders do
  @moduledoc "Order lifecycle — placement, cancellation, fulfillment."
  alias MyApp.Orders.Order

  def cancel_order(order_id) do
    with {:ok, order} <- fetch_order(order_id),
         true <- Order.can_cancel?(order),
         {:ok, order} <- mark_cancelled(order),
         :ok <- notify_cancellation(order) do
      {:ok, order}
    else
      false -> {:error, :not_cancellable}
      error -> error
    end
  end
end
```

**For most Elixir applications**, keep entities as internal modules (`@moduledoc false`) and use cases as public context functions. Separate them explicitly only when entity rules are complex enough to warrant independent testing and reuse across multiple use cases.

### 6.2 When to create a new context

**Create a new context when:**

- Different business domain (Catalog vs. ShoppingCart vs. Accounts)
- Different teams will own the code
- Data has a distinct lifecycle (orders vs. products)
- Entities have different consistency requirements
- When in doubt — prefer separate contexts. Merging is easier than splitting later.

**DON'T split when:**

- Entities share the same aggregate root (Order and OrderItem — same context)
- Operations always change together in a transaction
- Splitting would require constant cross-context calls
- The contexts would be thin wrappers around a shared set of operations

**Smell tests that say "split this":**

- The context file is over ~800 lines of public functions
- Two clusters of functions never reference each other's data
- Different teams keep stepping on each other's changes
- One set of functions changes for reason A, another for reason B (single-responsibility violation)

### 6.3 Aggregates — the consistency boundary

An **aggregate** is a cluster of entities that must be consistent as a unit. The **aggregate root** is the entity you load, validate, and save as a whole. In Ecto this maps to `cast_assoc` / `cast_embed`:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Orders.Order do
  use Ecto.Schema

  schema "orders" do
    field :status, Ecto.Enum, values: [:pending, :confirmed, :shipped]
    has_many :items, MyApp.Orders.OrderItem, on_replace: :delete
    timestamps()
  end

  def changeset(order, attrs) do
    order
    |> cast(attrs, [:status])
    |> cast_assoc(:items)                    # Items validated + saved WITH the order
    |> validate_at_least_one_item()
  end
end

# Context operates on the aggregate root, never individual items
defmodule MyApp.Orders do
  def add_item(order, item_attrs) do
    items = order.items ++ [item_attrs]
    update_order(order, %{items: items})     # Whole aggregate saved together
  end
end
```

**Aggregate rules:**

- Never load or save parts of an aggregate independently — always go through the root
- Each aggregate is a transaction boundary — one `Repo.insert`/`update` per aggregate
- Different aggregates communicate through the context's public API, not direct associations
- If two entities must be consistent, they belong in the same aggregate → same context

### 6.4 Boundary structure template

```elixir
# With Ecto (Phoenix, database-backed apps)
defmodule MyApp.Catalog do
  @moduledoc "Product catalog management."

  import Ecto.Query, warn: false
  alias MyApp.Repo
  alias MyApp.Catalog.{Product, Category}

  # Queries
  def list_products, do: Repo.all(Product)
  def get_product!(id), do: Repo.get!(Product, id)

  # Commands
  def create_product(attrs \\ %{}) do
    %Product{}
    |> Product.changeset(attrs)
    |> Repo.insert()
  end
end

# Without Ecto (Nerves, CLI, pure OTP services)
defmodule MyFirmware.Sensors do
  @moduledoc "Sensor reading and calibration."
  alias MyFirmware.Sensors.{Reader, Calibration}

  defdelegate read(sensor_id), to: Reader
  defdelegate calibrate(sensor_id, reference), to: Calibration

  def read_calibrated(sensor_id) do
    with {:ok, raw} <- Reader.read(sensor_id),
         {:ok, cal} <- Calibration.get(sensor_id) do
      {:ok, Calibration.apply(raw, cal)}
    end
  end
end
```

**Internal modules are private to the boundary:**

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Catalog.Product do
  @moduledoc false                          # Internal — not part of public API
  use Ecto.Schema
  # ...
end
```

**Context organization inside a context:**

```
lib/my_app/catalog/
├── product.ex              # Schema (internal)
├── category.ex             # Schema (internal)
├── product_queries.ex      # Complex query builders (internal)
├── import_worker.ex        # Background processing (internal)
└── price_calculator.ex     # Pure business logic (internal)
```

All internal modules are private. Only `MyApp.Catalog` is the public API.

### 6.5 Context relationships (context mapping)

Contexts don't exist in isolation — they relate to each other in specific ways.

| Relationship | Meaning | Elixir implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **Shared kernel** | Two contexts share a data structure | Shared module in a common namespace (e.g., `MyApp.Shared.Money`) |
| **Customer-supplier** | One context serves another | Supplier exposes public API, customer calls it |
| **Conformist** | You adapt to an external model | Anti-corruption layer translates their types to yours |
| **Separate ways** | Contexts are independent | No direct communication, possibly PubSub |

**Boundary atom-safety discipline:** every external string identifier crossing into a context — sort key from a query string, action name from a webhook, role name from a JWT claim, channel topic suffix — stays a string OR converts via `String.to_existing_atom/1` against a closed allowlist (`Ecto.Enum` is the canonical pattern). Never `String.to_atom/1` on request data. See §1 rule 24.


### 6.6 Anti-corruption layer (ACL)

When integrating with external or legacy systems, translate their data model to yours at the boundary. **Never let foreign data structures leak into your domain.**

```elixir
# BAD — external API's data model leaks into domain
def process_payment(stripe_charge) do
  if stripe_charge["status"] == "succeeded" do
    update_order(stripe_charge["metadata"]["order_id"], stripe_charge["amount"])
  end
end

# GOOD — anti-corruption layer translates at the boundary
defmodule MyApp.PaymentGateway.Stripe do
  @behaviour MyApp.PaymentGateway

  @impl true
  def charge(amount, token) do
    case Stripe.Charge.create(%{amount: amount, source: token}) do
      {:ok, charge} -> {:ok, to_domain_result(charge)}
      {:error, err} -> {:error, to_domain_error(err)}
    end
  end

  # Translation layer — Stripe's model → our domain model
  defp to_domain_result(charge) do
    %{transaction_id: charge.id, amount: charge.amount, captured_at: DateTime.utc_now()}
  end

  defp to_domain_error(%{code: "card_declined"}), do: :card_declined
  defp to_domain_error(%{code: "expired_card"}), do: :card_expired
  defp to_domain_error(_), do: :payment_failed
end
```

**Rule:** The behaviour adapter IS the anti-corruption layer. All translation between external and domain models happens in the adapter module. Domain code never sees external data structures.

### 6.7 API design for contexts

When designing a context's public API:

| Design choice | Why |
|---|---|
| Each public function is a use case | Not just a CRUD wrapper — name it by business intent (`register_user`, not `insert_user`) |
| Return `{:ok, _} / {:error, _}` | Consistent, composable with `with` |
| Keyword options at the end | Easy to extend without breaking callers |
| Validate options with `Keyword.validate!/2` | Reject typos, document accepted options |
| `defdelegate` for pure pass-through to internals | Keeps context as a clean facade |
| Regular `def` when you add logging, telemetry, cross-cutting logic | The context is more than a namespace — it's the place for cross-cutting concerns |
| **Decide opacity for every struct that crosses the boundary** | Without this, the struct's field shape silently becomes part of your public API. Once 11 callers destructure it, renaming a field is a breaking change. Pick "opaque handle" (MapSet/Ecto.Query — `@opaque` + accessor functions) or "public data structure" (Plug.Conn/Date — fields documented as API) **explicitly per struct**. Defer to [architecture-patterns.md §4.12](architecture-patterns.md) for the decision table, mechanics, and migration path. |

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Catalog do
  # Pure pass-through — defdelegate
  defdelegate get_product!(id), to: Product, as: :fetch!

  # Wrapper with cross-cutting concerns
  def calculate_price(product, qty) do
    product
    |> PriceCalculator.total(qty)
    |> tap(fn total -> :telemetry.execute([:catalog, :priced], %{total: total}) end)
  end

  # Keyword options pattern
  def list_products(opts \\ []) do
    opts = Keyword.validate!(opts, category: nil, in_stock: nil, limit: 50)
    # ...
  end
end
```

## 7. Data Ownership & Consistency

> **Depth:** [data-ownership-deep.md](data-ownership-deep.md) — aggregate design, multi-tenancy strategies (row-level/schema-per-tenant/DB-per-tenant), cross-context transactions, sagas, idempotency patterns, data ownership migration path.

### 7.1 Who owns the data?

**Every table (or storage location) is owned by exactly one context. That context is the only one allowed to write.** Other contexts read through the owning context's public API.

```elixir
# Accounts OWNS users — only Accounts writes
defmodule MyApp.Accounts do
  def create_user(attrs) do
    %User{} |> User.changeset(attrs) |> Repo.insert()
  end
  def get_user!(id), do: Repo.get!(User, id)
end

# Orders REFERENCES users — never writes to users table
defmodule MyApp.Orders do
  def create_order(user_id, items) do
    user = MyApp.Accounts.get_user!(user_id)   # Read via owning context
    # ... create order with user_id foreign key
  end
end
```

**When two contexts seem to need the same table:** either one owns it and the other reads through the API, or the data belongs in a shared kernel module. Never have two contexts writing to the same table.

**Cross-context foreign keys are fine**, but always fetch data through the owning context's public API. Never `Repo.preload` across context boundaries.

### 7.2 Cross-context transactions

What happens when an operation spans multiple contexts?

```elixir
# BAD — reaching into multiple contexts' internals in one transaction
Repo.transaction(fn ->
  Repo.insert!(%Order{...})             # Orders context data
  Repo.update!(%Product{stock: ...})    # Catalog context data
  Repo.insert!(%Payment{...})           # Billing context data
end)
```

**Three options:**

**Option 1 — Saga pattern** (sequence of compensating operations):

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.OrderSaga do
  def place_order(user_id, items) do
    with {:ok, reservation} <- Catalog.reserve_stock(items),
         {:ok, payment} <- Billing.charge(user_id, total(items)),
         {:ok, order} <- Orders.create(user_id, items, payment.id) do
      {:ok, order}
    else
      {:error, :payment_failed} ->
        Catalog.release_stock(reservation)    # Compensating action
        {:error, :payment_failed}
      {:error, :out_of_stock} ->
        {:error, :out_of_stock}
    end
  end
end
```

**Option 2 — Eventual consistency** (async side effects):

```elixir
def place_order(user_id, items) do
  with {:ok, order} <- Orders.create(user_id, items) do
    Oban.insert(StockReductionWorker.new(%{order_id: order.id}))
    Oban.insert(PaymentChargeWorker.new(%{order_id: order.id}))
    {:ok, order}
  end
end
```

**Option 3 — Merge contexts** if they always change together:

If Orders and Billing are always modified in the same transaction, they belong in the same context — the split was premature.

### 7.3 Cross-context transaction decision

| Operation characteristic | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Operations always happen together, synchronously | Merge into one context, use `Ecto.Multi` |
| Operations can fail independently | Saga with compensating actions |
| Eventual consistency is acceptable | Async via Oban |
| Full audit trail required | Event sourcing with process managers |

### 7.4 Idempotency — design for retries

**Any operation that may be retried must be idempotent** — executing it multiple times produces the same result as executing once.

```elixir
# BAD — not idempotent; double-charges on retry
def charge_order(order_id) do
  order = Orders.get_order!(order_id)
  PaymentGateway.charge(order.total, order.token)   # Charges every time!
end

# GOOD — idempotent; check if already done
def charge_order(order_id) do
  order = Orders.get_order!(order_id)
  case order.payment_status do
    :charged -> {:ok, order}                         # Already done
    :pending ->
      with {:ok, result} <- PaymentGateway.charge(order.total, order.token) do
        Orders.mark_charged(order, result.transaction_id)
      end
  end
end

# GOOD — idempotency via Oban unique constraints
%{order_id: order.id}
|> ChargeWorker.new(unique: [period: 300, keys: [:order_id]])
|> Oban.insert()

# GOOD — idempotency via DB constraints
def record_event(event_id, data) do
  %Event{id: event_id, data: data}
  |> Repo.insert(on_conflict: :nothing)              # Silently skip duplicates
end
```

**Operations that MUST be idempotent:**

- Oban workers (retried on failure)
- Webhook handlers (provider may retry)
- Event handlers / projectors (may replay)
- Anything called via `:erpc` or HTTP (network may retry)
- Saga compensating actions

### 7.5 Eventual consistency

When contexts communicate asynchronously, different parts may temporarily disagree.

**Rules:**

- Accept eventual consistency for non-critical reads (dashboards, analytics, search)
- Require strong consistency for financial operations (use `Ecto.Multi` or saga)
- Show clear state indicators in UI ("processing", "confirmed", "failed")
- Design event handlers to be idempotent — they may process the same event twice
- Use optimistic UI updates (show expected state immediately, correct via PubSub later)

### 7.6 Multi-tenancy

**Decide the tenancy strategy at project start.** Retrofitting is painful.

| Strategy | Isolation | Complexity | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Row-level** (tenant_id column) | Low — shared tables | Low | Most SaaS apps; single database; simplest |
| **Schema-per-tenant** (Postgres schemas) | Medium — separate tables, shared DB | Medium | Stronger isolation; moderate tenant count (<1000) |
| **Database-per-tenant** | High — full isolation | High | Regulatory requirement; very different data sizes; separate backups |

**Row-level (default — start here):**

Every table has a `tenant_id` column. Enforce at the data layer — never rely on callers remembering to filter:

```elixir
# Repo-level enforcement via prepare_query
defmodule MyApp.Repo do
  use Ecto.Repo, otp_app: :my_app

  @impl true
  def prepare_query(_operation, query, opts) do
    case opts[:tenant_id] || Process.get(:current_tenant_id) do
      nil -> {query, opts}
      tenant_id -> {where(query, tenant_id: ^tenant_id), opts}
    end
  end
end
```

**Architectural rules for multi-tenancy:**

1. Choose tenant strategy early — it affects every context, every query, every migration
2. Tenant scoping is infrastructure, not domain — enforce in the repo/data layer, not scattered across contexts
3. Pass `tenant_id` explicitly OR set it once at the interface boundary (Plug, GenServer init) — don't scatter tenant resolution
4. For schema- or DB-per-tenant, each tenant may need its own process subtree (connection pool, cache, workers)
5. **Test with multiple tenants.** The #1 multi-tenancy bug is data leaking between tenants.

## 8. Process Architecture

The supervision tree IS the architecture. Start order expresses dependencies, strategy expresses coupling, and the error kernel concept organizes what must survive.

> **Depth:** [process-topology.md](process-topology.md) — supervision tree design, error kernel, process patterns (service/entity/hybrid), stateful vs stateless, instructions pattern, callback module pattern. [otp-design.md](otp-design.md) — GenServer vs Task vs Agent vs `:gen_statem` vs ETS vs `:persistent_term` vs GenStage vs Oban — the OTP construct choice.

### 8.1 Do you need a process at all?

The first process-architecture question. Most code does NOT need a process.

| Situation | Need a process? |
|---|---|
| Pure data transformation | **No** — pure function |
| Stateless request / response (CRUD) | **No** — context + Repo |
| State that lives for one function call | **No** — pass as arg, return new state |
| State shared across MULTIPLE callers | **Yes** |
| Serializing access to a single resource (one writer) | **Yes** — GenServer |
| State that must survive a crash | **Yes** (supervised) + recovery strategy |
| Long-running scheduled work | **Yes** (GenServer or Oban) |
| Parallel independent work | **Task** (short-lived) or GenServer (long-lived) |
| Per-entity state (user, game, device) | **Yes** — DynamicSupervisor + Registry |

**Rule:** Default to pure functions and stateless context calls. Introduce a process only when a concrete requirement forces it.

### 8.2 Error kernel design

The **error kernel** is the minimal set of processes that must not fail for the system to function. Everything else is expendable and can crash freely.

```
Application Supervisor (:one_for_one)
├── Telemetry              # Must survive (observability)
├── Repo                   # Must survive (data access)
├── PubSub                 # Must survive (communication)
│
│   ─── ERROR KERNEL BOUNDARY ───
│   Above: stable infrastructure.
│   Below: volatile, can crash and recover.
│
├── DomainServices (:rest_for_one supervisor)
│   ├── Cache              # Volatile — rebuilt from DB on restart
│   ├── EventProcessor     # Volatile — replays from last checkpoint
│   └── NotificationQueue  # Volatile — Oban persists pending jobs
├── WorkerManager (:one_for_all supervisor)
│   ├── WorkerRegistry     # Tightly coupled pair
│   └── WorkerSupervisor   # DynamicSupervisor for workers
└── Endpoint               # Web — last (serve only when ready)
```

**Design principles:**

- Critical state (DB, PubSub, telemetry) starts FIRST and lives at the TOP
- Volatile processes (caches, processors, workers) live BELOW — they can crash and recover
- Workers under DynamicSupervisor are fully expendable — each crash is isolated
- Endpoint starts LAST — don't accept traffic until the system is ready

### 8.3 Supervision as architecture

The supervision tree encodes three things:

1. **Start order** — dependency order (top to bottom)
2. **Restart strategy** — coupling between children
3. **Placement in the tree** — blast radius of a crash

**Supervision strategy — decision table:**

| Strategy | Restarts | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `:one_for_one` | Only the crashed child | Children are independent (default at top level) |
| `:rest_for_one` | Crashed child + all children started AFTER it | Later children depend on earlier ones |
| `:one_for_all` | All children | Children are tightly coupled; must restart together |

**Architectural rules expressed through supervision:**

- **Start order = dependency order** — children listed first start first
- **`:rest_for_one`** = later children depend on earlier ones (Cache → Processor → Notifier)
- **`:one_for_all`** = tightly coupled subsystem (Registry + DynamicSupervisor MUST be in sync)
- **`:one_for_one`** at top level = independent subsystems
- **Endpoint last** = don't accept requests until everything is ready

### 8.4 Which OTP construct for the process?

Given you've decided a process is needed, which construct?

| Need | Construct | Why |
|---|---|---|
| One-off async side-effect work, supervised | `Task.Supervisor.start_child/2` | Supervised, no state |
| Parallel map with concurrency control | `Task.async_stream/3,5` | Built-in concurrency + backpressure |
| Long-running worker with state | GenServer | Standard behaviour, well-tooled |
| Explicit state machine with transitions | `:gen_statem` | Cleaner than huge `case` in GenServer |
| Single-value concurrent update | `Agent` | Lightweight wrapper around GenServer |
| Read-heavy shared data | ETS | Avoids GenServer bottleneck |
| Atomic counters / gauges | `:counters` / `:atomics` | Lock-free, very fast |
| Rarely-changing global config | `:persistent_term` | O(1) reads; expensive writes |
| Backpressured data pipeline | GenStage / Broadway | Designed for flow control |
| Persistent job queue with retries | Oban | Durable, observable |
| Many transient processes (per-entity) | DynamicSupervisor + Registry | Start/stop dynamically, find by key |
| Pub/sub within a node | `Registry :duplicate` or `Phoenix.PubSub` | Native dispatch |

**For implementation details of each**, load `elixir-implementing` §9.

### 8.5 Stateful vs stateless design

A key decision: should a process hold state in memory, or reconstruct it from a data store on each call?

| Approach | Trade-off | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| **Stateless** (reconstruct from DB on each call) | Slower reads, crash-resilient | CRUD operations, request handlers, most web contexts |
| **Stateful** (state in process memory) | Fast reads, state lost on crash | Real-time data, caches, active sessions, hardware connections |
| **Hybrid** (process state + periodic persistence) | Best of both, more complex | Game state, long-running workflows, IoT device state |

**The decision rule:** Hold state in a process only when you need it — for performance (avoid repeated DB hits), for real-time responsiveness (sub-ms access), or because the state has no durable store (hardware connections, WebSocket sessions, in-flight computations).

**Recovery strategy for stateful processes:**

Every stateful process must answer: **what happens on crash?**

- Reconstruct from DB on restart (event sourcing, periodic snapshots)
- Accept empty state (cache, ephemeral session)
- Fetch from peer (clustered cache replication)
- Crash means data loss (acceptable for purely ephemeral processes)

If you can't answer this, the process shouldn't be stateful.

### 8.6 Process architecture patterns

**Process-per-service (most common):**

One long-lived process per service capability, not per entity:

```elixir
children = [
  MyApp.Repo,              # One DB connection pool
  MyApp.Cache,             # One cache service
  MyApp.Mailer,            # One email sender
  MyApp.RateLimiter        # One rate limiting service
]
```

**Use when:** Service has shared state (connection pool, cache, counters). This is the default for most applications.

**Process-per-entity (when needed):**

One process per domain entity, each managing its own state:

```elixir
# Game server — one process per active game
DynamicSupervisor.start_child(GameSupervisor, {GameServer, game_id: id})

# IoT device — one process per connected device
DynamicSupervisor.start_child(DeviceSupervisor, {DeviceHandler, device_id: id})
```

**Use when:** Entities have independent state, need isolated failure domains, or communicate asynchronously. **Watch for:** memory scales linearly with entity count.

**Hybrid — Service + Entity Pool:**

Service process manages lifecycle, DynamicSupervisor manages instances:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.GameManager do
  def start_game(params) do
    game_id = generate_id()
    {:ok, _pid} = DynamicSupervisor.start_child(
      MyApp.GameSupervisor,
      {MyApp.GameServer, {game_id, params}}
    )
    {:ok, game_id}
  end
  def find_game(game_id), do: MyApp.GameRegistry.lookup(game_id)
end
```

**Canonical template — per-entity supervision with boot replay:**

The complete shape for "one process per live entity, with all entities re-hydrated on boot" is a four-piece subtree under a `:one_for_all` supervisor. This is the template that drops into most IoT / per-game / per-session apps:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Fleet.Supervisor do
  use Supervisor

  def start_link(opts), do: Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, opts, name: __MODULE__)

  @impl true
  def init(_opts) do
    children = [
      MyApp.Fleet.Registry,       # 1. via-tuple registry — started first
      MyApp.Fleet.DynSup,         # 2. DynamicSupervisor — starts/stops entity workers
      MyApp.Fleet.Boot            # 3. Boot GenServer — replays entities from DB
    ]
    # :one_for_all — Registry and DynSup are tightly coupled. If Registry
    # restarts, DynSup children lose their names; if DynSup restarts, its
    # children's registrations are orphaned. Restart the whole subtree.
    Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_all)
  end
end

defmodule MyApp.Fleet.Registry do
  def child_spec(_), do: Registry.child_spec(keys: :unique, name: __MODULE__)
  def via(id), do: {:via, Registry, {__MODULE__, id}}
end

defmodule MyApp.Fleet.DynSup do
  use DynamicSupervisor
  def start_link(_), do: DynamicSupervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, name: __MODULE__)
  @impl true
  def init(:ok), do: DynamicSupervisor.init(strategy: :one_for_one)

  def start_worker(id, opts \\ []) do
    DynamicSupervisor.start_child(__MODULE__, {MyApp.Fleet.Worker, [id: id] ++ opts})
  end
end

defmodule MyApp.Fleet.Boot do
  @moduledoc "On start, replays every persisted entity as a worker process."
  use GenServer

  def start_link(_), do: GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok)

  @impl true
  def init(:ok), do: {:ok, %{}, {:continue, :boot}}

  @impl true
  def handle_continue(:boot, state) do
    MyApp.Fleet.list_persisted_ids()
    |> Enum.each(&MyApp.Fleet.DynSup.start_worker/1)
    {:noreply, state}
  end
end
```

**Why this shape:**

- Registry started FIRST (Worker `start_link` uses its via-tuple).
- DynamicSupervisor started SECOND (has no children yet — safe without Registry).
- Boot started THIRD and uses `handle_continue/2` so `init/1` returns fast (doesn't block the supervisor's start sequence).
- `:one_for_all` reflects the tight coupling — if any piece dies, restart the whole subtree so re-registrations don't drift.
- Boot owns the "fleet re-hydration" decision explicitly — there's no magic "processes auto-start somewhere." The module that re-creates N workers is named.

**Use when:** one process per domain entity (devices, games, sessions, customers on a live-seat system). **Skip when:** entities are ephemeral request-scoped (use `Task.Supervisor`) or fully stateless (use pure functions + DB).

### 8.7 The Instructions Pattern (for complex domain + side-effects)

When domain logic needs to trigger side effects (notifications, messages, I/O), don't perform them inline. Instead, pure domain functions return a list of **instructions** — data describing what should happen — and the caller (GenServer, controller, test) interprets them.

```elixir
# Pure domain module — no side effects, no process mechanics
defmodule MyApp.Workflow do
  defstruct [:state, :participants, instructions: []]

  @spec advance(t(), participant_id(), action()) :: {[instruction()], t()}
  def advance(workflow, participant_id, action) do
    workflow
    |> validate_participant(participant_id)
    |> apply_action(action)
    |> maybe_transition()
    |> emit_instructions()
  end

  # Returns instructions like:
  # [
  #   {:notify, participant_id, {:status_changed, :approved}},
  #   {:notify, reviewer_id, {:task_assigned, task}},
  #   {:schedule, {:deadline, task_id}, :timer.hours(24)}
  # ]
end

# GenServer interprets the instructions
defmodule MyApp.WorkflowServer do
  use GenServer

  @impl true
  def handle_call({:advance, pid, action}, _from, state) do
    {instructions, workflow} = MyApp.Workflow.advance(state.workflow, pid, action)
    execute_instructions(instructions, state)
    {:reply, :ok, %{state | workflow: workflow}}
  end
end
```

**Benefits:**

- Domain logic is pure and trivially testable — assert on returned instructions, no mocking needed
- Multiple drivers — same domain module can be driven by GenServer, LiveView, test, or IEx
- Temporal concerns (retries, timeouts, delivery) stay out of domain

**Use when:** The domain has complex state transitions and multiple kinds of side effects. For simple GenServers, normal delegation to pure helpers (Principle 6) is enough.

### 8.8 Anti-patterns in process design

**Simulating objects with processes (very common mistake):**

```elixir
# BAD — one Agent per domain concept
cart_agent = Agent.start_link(fn -> Cart.new() end)
inventory_agent = Agent.start_link(fn -> Inventory.new(products) end)
# Every operation now requires cross-process messaging to coordinate
Agent.update(cart_agent, fn cart ->
  item = Agent.get(inventory_agent, fn inv -> Inventory.take(inv, sku) end)
  Cart.add(cart, item)
end)

# GOOD — pure functional abstractions — modules and functions, no processes
cart = Cart.new()
{:ok, item, inventory} = Inventory.take(inventory, sku)
cart = Cart.add(cart, item)
# Simple, testable, no overhead.
```

**Rule:** Use functions and modules to separate *thought concerns* (domain concepts in your mental model). Use processes to separate *runtime concerns* (fault isolation, parallelism, independent lifecycles). If multiple concepts always change together in one flow, they belong in the same process (or no process at all).

**Decision test:** Ask "do these things need to fail independently? Run in parallel? Have different lifecycles?" If not, they belong together.

**Other process anti-patterns:**

```elixir
# BAD — GenServer.call for reads on a hot path (bottleneck)
def get(key), do: GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:get, key})
# Every reader serializes through the GenServer.

# GOOD — direct ETS read (no serialization)
def get(key) do
  case :ets.lookup(:my_table, key) do
    [{^key, v}] -> {:ok, v}
    [] -> :error
  end
end
```

```elixir
# BAD — Registry + DynamicSupervisor under :one_for_one
# If Registry crashes, DynamicSupervisor's children can't re-register
children = [
  {Registry, keys: :unique, name: MyApp.Registry},
  {DynamicSupervisor, name: MyApp.DynSup}
]
Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)   # WRONG

# GOOD — :rest_for_one (or dedicated :one_for_all sub-supervisor)
Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :rest_for_one)
```

---

## 9. Inter-Context Communication

How contexts talk to each other is a critical architectural decision. The six mechanisms, in order of escalating complexity — **start with the simplest**, escalate only when the current one fails.

> **Depth:** [integration-patterns.md](integration-patterns.md) — six mechanisms in full depth, capacity planning, escalation triggers, sagas, process managers, external brokers (Kafka/SQS/RabbitMQ), cross-Elixir with `:erpc`/`:pg`.

### 9.1 Pattern 1: Direct function calls (default)

The simplest approach. Context A calls Context B's public API directly.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ShoppingCart do
  alias MyApp.Catalog

  def add_item_to_cart(cart, product_id) do
    product = Catalog.get_product!(product_id)   # Through Catalog public API
    # ... NOT Repo.get!(Product, id) — never reach into another context's data
  end
end
```

**Use when:** Synchronous, request-scoped, simple dependency. The caller needs the result immediately. **This is the right default for most cross-context calls.**

**Properties:** Zero persistence, zero backpressure, zero cross-node. You get a direct return value synchronously. If the callee is slow, your caller is slow.

### 9.2 Pattern 2: PubSub (fire-and-forget events)

Decoupled asynchronous communication — the publisher doesn't know or care who listens.

**Two options:**

- **`Phoenix.PubSub`** (if Phoenix is a dep) — topic-based, pluggable adapters
- **`:pg`** (Erlang built-in, OTP 23+) — process groups, no dependencies, cross-node

```elixir
# Phoenix.PubSub
Phoenix.PubSub.subscribe(MyApp.PubSub, "orders")
Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast(MyApp.PubSub, "orders", {:order_completed, order})

# Erlang :pg
:pg.join(:my_app_pubsub, "orders", self())
:pg.get_members(:my_app_pubsub, "orders") |> Enum.each(&send(&1, {:order_completed, order}))
```

**Limitations (both):**

- **No persistence** — subscriber down when event fires = event lost forever
- **No backpressure** — fast publisher overwhelms slow subscriber; mailbox grows unbounded
- **No ordering guarantees** — across nodes, messages may arrive out of order
- **No delivery confirmation** — publisher doesn't know if anyone received

**Use when:** UI updates (LiveView), notifications where occasional loss is OK, decoupling contexts where subscribers can tolerate missed events, in-process event fan-out.

### 9.3 Pattern 3: Registry for fine-grained PubSub

When PubSub topics are too coarse, use Registry with `:duplicate` keys for per-entity subscriptions.

```elixir
# Subscribe to specific entity events
Registry.register(MyApp.EventRegistry, {:order, order_id}, [])

# Broadcast to specific entity subscribers only
Registry.dispatch(MyApp.EventRegistry, {:order, order_id}, fn entries ->
  for {pid, _} <- entries, do: send(pid, {:order_updated, order})
end)
```

**Use when:** Per-entity subscriptions (e.g., LiveView watching one order). More efficient than broad PubSub topics with many entities.

**Limitations:** Single-node only (for cross-node per-entity dispatch, use `:pg` or Phoenix.PubSub with sharded topic).

### 9.4 Pattern 4: GenStage / Broadway (backpressure pipelines)

**GenStage** solves a fundamental problem: what happens when producers are faster than consumers? PubSub has no answer — mailboxes grow unbounded until crash. GenStage inverts control — consumers request data when ready (demand-driven).

```elixir
# Producer: buffers events, dispatches on demand
defmodule MyApp.OrderProducer do
  use GenStage
  def start_link(_), do: GenStage.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, name: __MODULE__)
  def init(:ok), do: {:producer, %{queue: :queue.new()}}

  def notify(event), do: GenStage.cast(__MODULE__, {:notify, event})

  # ... dispatch events to consumers based on demand
end

# Consumer: processes at its own pace
defmodule MyApp.OrderProcessor do
  use GenStage
  def init(:ok), do: {:consumer, :ok, subscribe_to: [{MyApp.OrderProducer, max_demand: 10}]}

  def handle_events(events, _from, state) do
    Enum.each(events, &process_order/1)
    {:noreply, [], state}
  end
end
```

**Broadway** wraps GenStage with a declarative API, batching, fault tolerance, and built-in adapters for message brokers.

**Choose GenStage over PubSub / plain messaging when:**

- Producer rate is variable / bursty and can exceed consumer throughput
- Data loss is unacceptable
- You need multi-stage transformation pipelines (producer → filter → transform → persist)
- Processing involves I/O that creates natural bottlenecks
- You need concurrency control

**Choose Broadway over raw GenStage when:**

- Consuming from an external broker (Kafka, SQS, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams)
- You need batching (accumulate N items, flush together)
- You want declarative concurrency config
- You need built-in fault tolerance, graceful shutdown, telemetry

**Don't use GenStage when:**

- Fan-out to UI (LiveView updates) — use PubSub, consumers are fast
- Occasional loss is acceptable (notifications, analytics)
- No transformation pipeline — just broadcast and forget

### 9.5 Pattern 5: Oban (persistent job queue)

When events must survive restarts, need scheduling, retries, and guaranteed execution.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Workers.SendConfirmation do
  use Oban.Worker, queue: :emails, max_attempts: 5

  @impl true
  def perform(%Oban.Job{args: %{"order_id" => order_id}}) do
    order = MyApp.Orders.get_order!(order_id)
    MyApp.Mailer.send_confirmation(order)
    :ok
  end
end

# In your context
def complete_order(order) do
  with {:ok, order} <- mark_completed(order) do
    %{order_id: order.id}
    |> MyApp.Workers.SendConfirmation.new()
    |> Oban.insert()
    {:ok, order}
  end
end
```

**Use when:**

- Jobs must not be lost (email, webhooks, billing)
- Need retries with backoff
- Need scheduling (run at specific times, cron)
- Need uniqueness constraints (deduplicate)

**Properties:** Persistent (PostgreSQL), backpressure via queue limits, cross-node (shared DB).

### 9.6 Pattern 6: Event sourcing / Commanded (full audit + replay)

Full history, replay, and complex multi-aggregate workflows.

**Use when:**

- Perfect audit trail is a business requirement (compliance)
- Complex long-lived processes (insurance claims, loan origination)
- Undo / replay capabilities needed
- Multiple very different read projections of the same data

**Defer to `event-sourcing` skill for implementation.**

### 9.7 Sagas and process managers

For multi-step workflows that must complete or compensate:

- **Explicit saga** — a function that calls context operations in sequence with explicit rollback on failure (§7.2 Option 1)
- **Process manager** (Commanded) — long-lived process that listens for events and emits commands in response; handles timeouts and retries declaratively

**Choose explicit saga when:** Workflow is bounded (few steps, fast completion). You can see the whole flow in one function.

**Choose process manager when:** Workflow is long-lived (minutes/days), driven by events, needs to wait for external completion.

### 9.8 Communication decision guide

| Need | Mechanism | Persistence | Backpressure | Cross-Node |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Simple sync call | Direct function | N/A | N/A | No |
| UI updates, notifications | Phoenix.PubSub / :pg | No | No | Yes |
| Per-entity subscriptions | Registry (`:duplicate`) | No | No | No |
| High-throughput pipeline | GenStage / Broadway | No (in-flight) | **Yes** | No |
| Reliable async jobs | Oban | **Yes** (PostgreSQL) | Yes (queue limits) | **Yes** |
| Full audit + replay | Commanded | **Yes** (event store) | Via subscriptions | **Yes** |
| Cross-service messaging | External broker + Broadway | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** |

### 9.9 Escalation path — when to move up the ladder

**Start with direct function calls. Escalate only when the current mechanism fails:**

```
Direct function call
  ↓ (need async / decoupling)
PubSub
  ↓ (PubSub subscriber mailbox growing? fast publisher, slow consumer?)
GenStage / Broadway
  ↓ (events lost on deploy/crash?)
Oban
  ↓ ("what happened and when?" / replay / compliance?)
Event sourcing (Commanded)
```

**Signals you've outgrown your current mechanism:**

- PubSub subscriber mailbox growing → need GenStage (backpressure)
- Events lost during deploys / crashes → need Oban (persistence)
- Need to batch writes for performance → need Broadway (batching)
- "What happened and when?" questions → need event sourcing (audit trail)

**Do not skip steps.** Each escalation adds complexity; unjustified complexity compounds.

## 10. Configuration Strategy

### 10.1 Config file roles

| File | Loaded when | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `config/config.exs` | Compile time | Defaults, application-owned compile-time values |
| `config/dev.exs` | Compile time (dev only) | Dev overrides (verbose logs, dev tooling) |
| `config/test.exs` | Compile time (test only) | Mox wiring, small pool sizes, test adapters |
| `config/runtime.exs` | Boot time (after release assembly) | Per-deployment env vars, secrets |

### 10.2 Compile-time vs runtime — decision

| Value character | API | File |
|---|---|---|
| Known at build, app-owned, immutable per release | `Application.compile_env!(:my_app, :key)` | `config/config.exs` |
| Per-deployment env var | `System.fetch_env!("VAR")` + `Application.get_env` | `config/runtime.exs` |
| Library consumer configures | `Application.get_env(:my_lib, :key, default)` at runtime; options to `start_link` | Caller's config files |
| Feature flag (toggleable without deploy) | External (FunWithFlags, Flagsmith, DB row, ETS) | Outside `config/*.exs` |
| Test-specific override | `config :my_app, ...` | `config/test.exs` |

### 10.3 Library vs application config

**Applications** can use `Application.compile_env` safely — they control their own build:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Cache do
  @ttl Application.compile_env!(:my_app, [:cache, :ttl])
  def ttl, do: @ttl
end
```

**Libraries MUST NOT** use `Application.compile_env` — consumers can't reconfigure after compilation:

```elixir
# BAD (in a library)
defmodule MyLib.Client do
  @api_key Application.compile_env!(:my_lib, :api_key)
  def call, do: request(@api_key)
end

# GOOD (in a library)
defmodule MyLib.Client do
  def call, do: request(api_key())
  defp api_key, do: Application.get_env(:my_lib, :api_key) ||
                      raise "configure :my_lib, :api_key"
end

# BEST (in a library) — accept as argument
defmodule MyLib.Client do
  def call(opts), do: request(Keyword.fetch!(opts, :api_key))
end
```

### 10.4 `runtime.exs` validation discipline

`runtime.exs` is where production blows up at boot — so the validation shape is a planning decision, not an implementation detail. Three rules:

1. **Validate the shape** — `System.fetch_env!/1` for required vars (raises clearly if missing); `System.get_env/2` with a typed default for optional ones.
2. **Bounded parse** — every string that becomes a port, pool size, timeout, URL, or boolean goes through a parser with explicit bounds. Don't feed raw env strings into `String.to_integer/1` without a range check; don't feed them into `String.to_atom/1` at all (atom table exhaustion — see elixir-reviewing §7.10).
3. **Explicit error message** — when validation fails, the error message says **which env var** was wrong and **what shape** was expected. "Invalid argument" is a production incident waiting to happen.

```elixir
# config/runtime.exs — shape and validation
import Config

if config_env() == :prod do
  database_url =
    System.get_env("DATABASE_URL") ||
      raise """
      DATABASE_URL is required in prod.
      Expected: ecto://USER:PASS@HOST/DB_NAME
      """

  pool_size =
    case System.get_env("POOL_SIZE", "10") |> Integer.parse() do
      {n, ""} when n in 1..100 -> n
      _ -> raise "POOL_SIZE must be an integer in 1..100"
    end

  config :my_app, MyApp.Repo, url: database_url, pool_size: pool_size
end
```

**NEVER** use `String.to_atom/1` or `String.to_existing_atom/1` on untrusted env input that can be arbitrary — use an explicit allowlist (`case val do "prod" -> :prod; "stage" -> :stage; ...`).

### 10.5 Config accessor shape — centralize reads

Planning decision: where do config reads *live* in the code? The answer is a single `MyApp.Config` module whose public functions are zero-arg accessors. Every other module routes config reads through it. Scattered `Application.get_env/3` calls across dozens of modules are a persistent anti-pattern — hard to mock consistently, hard to audit, hard to swap in tests.

In an umbrella with separate deployables, each app gets its own `MyApp.Config` (e.g. `Nodepulse.Config` for the central app, `NodepulseEdge.Config` for the edge app). Shared wire/protocol libs use the default Application env pattern so consumers configure them from the outside.

The concrete module shape is in `elixir-implementing` §10.5.1. The planning commitment is: name the module now (e.g. "Nodepulse will have `Nodepulse.Config`"), and every config access goes through it.

### 10.6 Configuration handoff to `elixir-implementing`

The implementation patterns for reading config (at-runtime vs at-boot, `fetch_env!` vs `get_env`, the `MyApp.Config` accessor module) are in `elixir-implementing` §10.5–10.5.1 and §8.6. This section is about **where values live**, **why**, and **how the plan pins down the shape** — the planning decision.

## 11. Resilience Planning

> **Related subskill:** [integration-patterns.md](integration-patterns.md) §10 — resilience at integration boundaries (circuit breakers around adapters, retries by layer, graceful degradation, timeout cascades).

OTP provides resilience primitives that other ecosystems need external libraries for. These patterns are **architectural** — they determine where failure handling lives and how subsystems degrade.

### 11.1 BEAM processes as bulkheads

Every BEAM process is an isolated failure domain — its own heap, its own GC, its own crash boundary. **This IS the bulkhead pattern.** When one process crashes, others are unaffected.

```elixir
children = [
  # If email sending fails, order processing continues
  {MyApp.Mailer.Pool, pool_size: 5},
  # If payment gateway is slow, catalog browsing is unaffected
  {MyApp.PaymentWorker, []},
  # If search indexing crashes, CRUD operations work fine
  {MyApp.SearchIndexer, []}
]
```

**Architectural rule:** Different concerns run in different processes. This gives you bulkhead isolation for free. **Never run unrelated work in the same GenServer** — split it.

### 11.2 Circuit breaker — where it belongs

Prevent cascading failures by stopping calls to a failing subsystem. In Elixir, implement with a GenServer or use the `:fuse` library.

**Architectural placement: around infrastructure adapters** (HTTP clients, external APIs, database calls to remote services). **NEVER in domain logic.**

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.PaymentGateway.Protected do
  @behaviour MyApp.PaymentGateway

  @impl true
  def charge(amount, token) do
    case :fuse.ask(:payment_fuse, :sync) do
      :ok ->
        case MyApp.PaymentGateway.Stripe.charge(amount, token) do
          {:ok, _} = success -> success
          {:error, :timeout} -> :fuse.melt(:payment_fuse); {:error, :service_unavailable}
          {:error, _} = error -> error
        end
      :blown -> {:error, :service_unavailable}
    end
  end
end

# Supervision — fuse must start before the service that uses it
children = [
  {Fuse, name: :payment_fuse, strategy: {:standard, 5, 60_000}},   # 5 failures in 60s
  MyApp.PaymentWorker
]
```

**Rule:** The domain receives `{:error, :service_unavailable}` and decides what to do (queue for retry, show cached data, return partial result). Domain never knows a circuit breaker exists.

### 11.3 Retry and backoff — where each lives

Retries belong in infrastructure, **never** in domain logic. Different layers handle retries at different scales.

| Layer | Retry mechanism | Example |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP client | Built-in retry | `Req.new(retry: :transient, max_retries: 3)` |
| Background jobs | Job-level retry | `use Oban.Worker, max_attempts: 5` |
| Event handlers | Handler-level retry | Commanded error callback with backoff |
| GenServer | Process restart (supervisor) | `max_restarts` / `max_seconds` on supervisor |
| Infrastructure adapter | Wrapper with custom backoff | Custom retry around external call |

**Idempotency is a prerequisite for safe retries.** If an operation isn't idempotent, retrying it may cause duplicate effects. See §7.3.

### 11.4 Graceful degradation

When a subsystem is down, serve degraded functionality instead of failing entirely.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Catalog do
  def get_product_with_recommendations(product_id) do
    product = get_product!(product_id)

    # Recommendations are nice-to-have — degrade if service is down
    recommendations =
      case MyApp.Recommendations.for_product(product_id) do
        {:ok, recs} -> recs
        {:error, _} -> []   # Show product without recommendations
      end

    {product, recommendations}
  end
end
```

**Architectural rule:** For each feature, identify whether it's **critical** (must work) or **nice-to-have** (can degrade). Critical paths use synchronous calls with clear error handling. Nice-to-have features use `try`-style fallbacks or cached data.

### 11.5 Timeout architecture

Timeouts must be set at **every boundary**, and **outer > middle > inner**. Otherwise outer timeouts fire before inner ones with meaningless errors.

```
Phoenix endpoint   : timeout 15_000ms     (outermost)
  GenServer.call   : timeout 10_000ms     (middle)
    HTTP client    : timeout 5_000ms      (innermost)

15_000 > 10_000 > 5_000  ✓
```

**Where to set timeouts:**

- HTTP clients: `receive_timeout` in Req/Finch
- GenServer calls: second argument to `GenServer.call/3` (default 5000ms — usually too short)
- `Task.await`: second argument (default 5000ms)
- DB queries: `:timeout` option in Repo operations
- Phoenix endpoint: `:timeout` in endpoint config

### 11.6 Resilience decision guide

| Concern | Solution | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| External service may be slow / flaky | Circuit breaker (:fuse) | Infrastructure adapter |
| Operation may fail transiently | Retry with backoff | Client library, Oban, supervisor |
| External service is down | Graceful degradation (partial / cached / default) | Context function (orchestration) |
| Timeouts across layers | Outer > middle > inner cascade | Every layer |
| Prevent one subsystem failing another | Separate processes / supervisors | Supervision tree |
| Prevent retries from duplicating | Idempotency | Operation design |

### 11.7 Observability & trace context

`Logger.metadata` is **per-process** — documented behaviour of the `Logger` module. Any async boundary that doesn't propagate it is a runtime observability defect: log lines and telemetry events from spawned work appear without the originating request's `trace_id` / `request_id` / `tenant_id`. They become orphan when an operator searches by correlation ID.

**Plan every async boundary's metadata strategy at design time:**

| Request shape | Metadata setter |
|---|---|
| Phoenix HTTP request | `Plug.RequestId` configured early in the endpoint pipeline (sets `:request_id` in `Logger.metadata`). |
| Phoenix Channel | A `set_metadata` plug or explicit `Logger.metadata/1` call in `join/3`. |
| Oban job | Producer writes `trace_id` etc. into `Oban.Job.args`; the worker's `perform/1` calls `Logger.metadata/1` from those args (Oban's own job metadata — `:job_id`, `:worker`, `:queue`, `:attempt` — is set by the executor before `perform/1`). |
| Bare `Task.async` / `Task.Supervisor.start_child` | Capture `Logger.metadata()` outside the closure, restore inside. |
| Cross-node `:erpc` / GenServer `call` across nodes | Pass an explicit `TraceContext` struct as part of the message payload — `Logger.metadata` is local to the calling process; the remote process needs the value to set its own metadata. |

**TraceContext template — explicit type for cross-node / cross-Oban / multi-hop scope:**

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.TraceContext do
  @enforce_keys [:trace_id]
  defstruct [:trace_id, :tenant_ref, :target_ref, :operation]

  @type t :: %__MODULE__{
    trace_id: String.t(),
    tenant_ref: String.t() | nil,
    target_ref: String.t() | nil,
    operation: atom() | nil
  }

  @spec from_logger() :: t()
  def from_logger do
    md = Logger.metadata()
    %__MODULE__{
      trace_id: Keyword.get(md, :trace_id) || generate_trace_id(),
      tenant_ref: Keyword.get(md, :tenant_ref),
      target_ref: Keyword.get(md, :target_ref),
      operation: Keyword.get(md, :operation)
    }
  end

  @spec apply_to_logger(t()) :: :ok
  def apply_to_logger(%__MODULE__{} = ctx) do
    Logger.metadata(
      trace_id: ctx.trace_id,
      tenant_ref: ctx.tenant_ref,
      target_ref: ctx.target_ref,
      operation: ctx.operation
    )
  end

  defp generate_trace_id, do: 16 |> :crypto.strong_rand_bytes() |> Base.url_encode64(padding: false)
end
```

**Decision: `Logger.metadata` propagation vs explicit `TraceContext`:**

| Choice | Use when |
|---|---|
| `Logger.metadata` capture+restore | Single async hop within one node; the metadata fits naturally in keyword form; you want backends/handlers to consume it without code changes. |
| `TraceContext` struct | Cross-node / cross-Oban / multiple async hops; the trace fields outlive the log scope; you want a typed contract enforced by `@spec`. |

**Telemetry rule:** every `:telemetry.execute/3` event that fires from an async closure must include `trace_id` (and any other relevant correlation IDs) in its **metadata** map — not rely on the receiving handler reading `Logger.metadata()`, because the handler runs in the *emitting* process, but a handler that re-publishes (e.g. to a remote sink) may not preserve metadata across that hop.

**Reference**: `Plug.RequestId` (`Logger.metadata([{logger_metadata_key, request_id}])`) is the canonical metadata-setter side; the propagation pattern relies on Logger's documented per-process scope. See `elixir-implementing` §5.12 for the keyboard-time templates.

## 12. Architectural Styles in Elixir

How common architectural styles map to Elixir idioms. **Many patterns that require frameworks in other languages are built into OTP.** Understand what Elixir gives you for free before reaching for external solutions.

### 12.1 What each style solves

Match a problem to an architectural approach. **Start with the simplest style.** Adopt a style because you have the specific problem it solves — not because it sounds sophisticated.

| Problem You Have | Style | Elixir Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Separate UI from logic | MVC | Thin dispatchers → contexts → structs (Elixir default) |
| Swappable external dependencies | Hexagonal / Ports & Adapters | Behaviours (ports) + implementations (adapters) + config |
| Fault isolation without separate deployments | Modular Monolith | Contexts + supervision trees (OTP default) |
| Decouple producers from consumers | Event Notification | PubSub / `:pg` — fire and forget |
| Subscribers need full data without calling back | Event-Carried State Transfer | PubSub with rich event payloads |
| Complete audit trail / state replay / compliance | Event Sourcing | Commanded — events are source of truth |
| Read and write patterns diverge | CQRS | Query modules, read replicas, or projections |
| Backpressure between fast producer and slow consumer | Demand-Driven | GenStage / Broadway |
| Side effects must survive crashes | Persistent Queue | Oban |
| Multi-step workflows must complete or compensate | Saga / Process Manager | Commanded process managers or Oban workflows |
| Different language / compliance / extreme scaling | Microservices | Separate deployments — last resort in Elixir |
| Protection against slow/failing external services | Resilience | Circuit breaker, bulkheads, timeouts |

**The default Elixir architecture** — contexts + supervision + behaviours — already gives you MVC, hexagonal, and modular monolith patterns simultaneously. **Most apps never need anything beyond this plus PubSub** for decoupling.

### 12.2 MVC — how it maps to Elixir

| Classical MVC | Elixir Reality |
|---|---|
| Model (ActiveRecord, ORM) | Contexts + schemas/structs (separated) |
| View (template / UI) | Function components, CLI formatters, display renderers |
| Controller (handles input) | Thin dispatcher — translates input, delegates to context |

| Interface | "Controller" | "View" | "Model" |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phoenix web | Controller / LiveView | HEEx templates, components | Contexts + Ecto schemas |
| CLI tool | `main/1` / escript entry | IO / formatting module | Contexts + structs |
| Nerves device | GenServer handling hardware | Display / output module | Contexts + structs |
| Library | Public API module | N/A | Internal modules |

**The LLM rule:** NEVER organize Elixir code into `models/`, `services/`, or `helpers/` directories. These are anti-patterns imported from Rails/Django. Elixir uses:

- **Contexts / boundary modules** where MVC would say "model" or "service"
- **Output / formatting modules** where MVC would say "view"
- **Thin dispatchers** where MVC would say "controller" — no business logic

```elixir
# BAD — imported "MVC" thinking
lib/my_app/
├── models/
│   └── user.ex
├── services/
│   └── user_service.ex
└── helpers/
    └── format_helper.ex

# GOOD — Elixir domain-driven structure
lib/my_app/
├── accounts.ex              # Context (boundary)
├── accounts/
│   ├── user.ex              # Schema / struct (internal)
│   └── authentication.ex    # Pure logic (internal)
└── catalog.ex               # Another context
```

### 12.3 Microservices — why Elixir rarely needs them

OTP already provides fault isolation (supervision), independent scaling (process pools), loose coupling (contexts + PubSub), and service discovery (Registry, `:pg`). **The Elixir default is the modular monolith** — one deployment, zero network hops.

**ONLY split into separate services when:**

| Signal | Why Separate Service |
|---|---|
| Different language needed | GPU service in Python/CUDA, web in Elixir |
| Regulatory / compliance isolation | Payment processing must be PCI-isolated |
| Wildly different scaling needs | Video transcoding vs. web API |
| Separate teams, separate release cycles | Organization-driven, not tech-driven |
| Legacy system integration | Wrap legacy behind an API boundary |

**NEVER split into services for:**

- "It's getting big" → add contexts
- "We want loose coupling" → use behaviours and PubSub
- "We want fault isolation" → use supervision trees
- "We want independent scaling" → process pools, Task.async_stream, Broadway

**If you must split:** Communicate via well-defined APIs (HTTP/gRPC), not shared databases. Each service owns its data. Use Broadway + message broker (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for async integration. Consider `:erpc` for Elixir-to-Elixir calls within a trusted network.

### 12.4 Event-driven architecture — three patterns

These three are often conflated. Distinguish them when designing.

**Pattern 1: Event Notification** — event carries minimal data (just an identifier).

```elixir
Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast(MyApp.PubSub, "orders", {:order_completed, order_id})

def handle_info({:order_completed, order_id}, state) do
  order = Orders.get_order!(order_id)    # Subscriber calls back for data
  send_confirmation(order)
  {:noreply, state}
end
```

**Trade-offs:** Simple. Publisher is decoupled. But subscriber must call back to source → creates coupling and potential N+1.

**Pattern 2: Event-Carried State Transfer** — event carries all data subscriber needs.

```elixir
event = %{
  order_id: order.id,
  customer_email: order.customer.email,
  items: Enum.map(order.items, &%{name: &1.name, qty: &1.quantity}),
  total: order.total,
  completed_at: DateTime.utc_now()
}
Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast(MyApp.PubSub, "orders", {:order_completed, event})

def handle_info({:order_completed, event}, state) do
  send_confirmation(event.customer_email, event)   # No callback needed
  {:noreply, state}
end
```

**Trade-offs:** Subscribers fully decoupled. Larger events. Publisher must anticipate subscriber needs.

**Pattern 3: Event Sourcing** — events ARE the source of truth. Current state is derived by replaying events. Defer to `event-sourcing` skill.

### 12.5 Event-driven decision guide

```
Do you need to decouple contexts?
├── No coupling needed               → Direct function call (not event-driven)
├── Fire-and-forget notification     → Event Notification (PubSub, :pg)
├── Subscriber needs data, no callback → Event-Carried State Transfer
├── Need backpressure                → GenStage / Broadway
├── Events must survive crashes      → Oban
└── Events ARE the source of truth   → Event Sourcing (Commanded)
```

### 12.6 CQRS — three levels

**Level 1: Light CQRS** (default — most apps already do this).

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Catalog do
  # Queries (reads)
  def list_products, do: Repo.all(Product)
  def get_product!(id), do: Repo.get!(Product, id)

  # Commands (writes)
  def create_product(attrs), do: %Product{} |> Product.changeset(attrs) |> Repo.insert()
  def delete_product(product), do: Repo.delete(product)
end
```

**This is CQRS.** Queries return data. Commands return ok/error. Same DB serves both. For most apps, this is enough.

**Level 2: Separated Read Path** (when reads need optimization).

```elixir
# Writes: standard context
defmodule MyApp.Catalog do
  def create_product(attrs), do: ...
  def update_product(product, attrs), do: ...
end

# Reads: specialized query module
defmodule MyApp.Catalog.Queries do
  @moduledoc false
  import Ecto.Query

  def top_sellers(limit \\ 10) do
    from(p in Product,
      join: oi in OrderItem, on: oi.product_id == p.id,
      group_by: p.id,
      order_by: [desc: count(oi.id)],
      limit: ^limit
    ) |> Repo.all()
  end
end
```

**Use when:** Dashboard/reporting queries are slow and contend with writes. Search needs a different store (Elasticsearch). Read traffic is 10x+ write.

**Level 3: Full CQRS + Projections** (with event sourcing).

Writes go to an event store. Reads come from purpose-built projections (materialized views), each optimized for a specific query pattern.

**Use when:** Event sourcing already in use. Multiple very different read views. Read and write scaling needs dramatically different. Eventual consistency between read models is acceptable.

### 12.7 CQRS decision guide

| Signal | Level |
|---|---|
| Standard web app, moderate traffic | Light (1) |
| Complex reporting alongside CRUD | Separated (2) |
| Dashboard queries contend with writes | Separated (2) — read replica |
| Full audit trail + different read stores | Full (3) — event sourcing |
| "Should I use CQRS?" uncertainty | Light (1) — you're probably already doing it |

### 12.8 Styles combine — per context

Different contexts within the same application can use different styles:

```
Typical large Elixir app (modular monolith):

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Accounts context          Orders context          │
│  ├─ Light CQRS             ├─ Event sourcing       │
│  ├─ Direct Ecto            │  (Commanded)          │
│  └─ Request-response       ├─ Full CQRS            │
│                            │  (projections)         │
│  Catalog context           ├─ Event-driven         │
│  ├─ Separated read path    │  (process managers)   │
│  │  (search index)         └─ Sagas for workflows  │
│  └─ Event-carried state                            │
│                                                     │
│  Notifications context                             │
│  ├─ Event notification                             │
│  │  (subscribes to PubSub)                          │
│  └─ Oban for delivery                              │
│                                                     │
│  ─── All in one Mix release, one supervision ───   │
│  ─── tree, one deployment                    ───   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key insight:** The boundary module (context) is what enables this — callers don't know or care what style is used internally. Start simple; evolve individual contexts into richer patterns as their domains demand.

---

## 13. Growing Architecture — Small to Large

Elixir architecture is **additive**. Do not over-engineer Stage 1. Do not under-engineer Stage 3. Know which stage you're at.

> **Depth:** [growing-evolution.md](growing-evolution.md) — full stage-by-stage evolution, symptoms → refactors, context redraws, integration mechanism escalation, when to add/remove each complexity layer.

### 13.1 Stage 1 — Small App (1–3 domains, one developer)

The simplest structure that enforces boundaries.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Application do
  use Application
  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [MyApp.Repo]     # Or nothing if no database
    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end
end

defmodule MyApp.Core do
  # Single boundary module — all public API here
  # Internal modules in MyApp.Core.* with @moduledoc false
end
```

**What matters at this stage:**

- Domain logic in pure functions (testable, no process overhead)
- External dependencies behind behaviours (at least: Repo)
- One supervision tree with flat `:one_for_one`
- **No PubSub, no GenStage, no event sourcing** — add only when needed

### 13.2 Stage 2 — Medium App (3–8 domains, small team)

Split into multiple boundary modules. Add processes only where needed.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Application do
  use Application
  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      MyApp.Repo,
      {Phoenix.PubSub, name: MyApp.PubSub},
      MyApp.Cache,                          # First GenServer — shared state
      MyAppWeb.Endpoint
    ]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end
end

defmodule MyApp.Accounts do ... end
defmodule MyApp.Catalog do ... end
defmodule MyApp.Billing do ... end
```

**What changes:**

- Multiple boundary modules with clear ownership
- PubSub for cross-boundary events (UI updates, notifications)
- First GenServers appear for genuinely shared mutable state
- Behaviours at external service boundaries (payment, email)
- Still one Mix application — contexts provide sufficient boundaries

### 13.3 Stage 3 — Large App (8+ domains, multiple teams)

Introduce supervision hierarchy. Consider umbrella for team boundaries.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Application do
  use Application
  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      # Infrastructure (error kernel)
      MyApp.Telemetry,
      MyApp.Repo,
      {Phoenix.PubSub, name: MyApp.PubSub},

      # Domain services (can crash and recover)
      {Supervisor, name: MyApp.DomainSupervisor, strategy: :rest_for_one,
        children: [
          MyApp.Cache,
          MyApp.EventProcessor,
          MyApp.NotificationService
        ]},

      # Dynamic workers
      {Supervisor, name: MyApp.WorkerSupervisor, strategy: :one_for_all,
        children: [
          {Registry, keys: :unique, name: MyApp.WorkerRegistry},
          {DynamicSupervisor, name: MyApp.Workers, max_children: 10_000}
        ]},

      MyAppWeb.Endpoint                    # Last
    ]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end
end
```

**What changes:**

- Nested supervision tree with error kernel design
- Oban for persistent background jobs
- GenStage / Broadway for high-throughput pipelines
- Telemetry instrumentation throughout
- Consider umbrella if teams need hard compile-time boundaries
- Event sourcing for domains that need audit trails

### 13.4 What DOES NOT change between stages

These hold at every scale — never restructure them:

- Domain logic is pure functions
- External dependencies are behind behaviours
- Boundary modules are the only public API
- `{:ok, _}` / `{:error, _}` tuples for results
- Supervision tree expresses architecture

**The progression is additive.** Add GenServers, PubSub, supervision layers as needed. Never restructure the fundamentals.

### 13.5 Refactoring decision tree

```
You notice something is wrong. Where to intervene?

Symptom: Module is doing too much.
├── Same context, multiple unrelated concerns → split into multiple contexts
├── Mixing business logic with infrastructure → extract behaviour, move impl to adapter
├── Pure logic buried inside GenServer → extract to pure module, GenServer delegates
└── Domain module referencing web/framework → inversion — domain defines behaviours, framework implements

Symptom: Testing is hard.
├── Needs Repo for pure logic tests → extract pure functions, test without Repo
├── Needs HTTP for business-rule tests → put HTTP behind behaviour, mock with Mox
├── Test uses complex setup of many modules → missing boundary, extract behaviour
└── Tests are flaky async → shared state; isolate or use async: false

Symptom: Performance.
├── GenServer bottleneck on reads → move to ETS
├── Slow queries contending with writes → separated read path or read replica
├── Large data in process state → move to ETS / :persistent_term
├── Producer faster than consumer → GenStage / Broadway
└── Retry storms → exponential backoff + circuit breaker

Symptom: Reliability.
├── Lost events → upgrade PubSub → Oban
├── Crashes propagate → split supervisors, review strategies
├── Cascading failures → circuit breakers around adapters
└── Timeouts at wrong layer → cascade outer > middle > inner
```

## 14. Architectural Anti-Patterns

### 14.1 Wrong module layout

```elixir
# BAD — "MVC" imported from other ecosystems
lib/my_app/
├── models/
│   └── user.ex
├── services/
│   └── user_service.ex
└── helpers/
    └── format_helper.ex

# GOOD — Elixir domain-driven
lib/my_app/
├── accounts.ex
├── accounts/
│   ├── user.ex
│   └── authentication.ex
└── catalog.ex
```

### 14.2 Domain depending on framework

```elixir
# BAD — domain module references web layer
defmodule MyApp.Orders do
  alias MyAppWeb.Router.Helpers, as: Routes    # NEVER — domain depends on web!
  import Phoenix.Controller                     # NEVER — framework in domain!

  def complete_order(order) do
    url = Routes.order_url(MyAppWeb.Endpoint, :show, order)
    # ...
  end
end

# GOOD — domain is framework-agnostic
defmodule MyApp.Orders do
  def complete_order(order) do
    # Pure domain logic. URL generation belongs in controller/LiveView.
    with {:ok, order} <- mark_completed(order), do: {:ok, order}
  end
end
```

### 14.3 Interface layer calling Repo directly

```elixir
# BAD — controller queries Repo
def index(conn, _) do
  products = Repo.all(Product)
  render(conn, :index, products: products)
end

# GOOD — controller calls context
def index(conn, _) do
  products = Catalog.list_products()
  render(conn, :index, products: products)
end
```

### 14.4 God context

```elixir
# BAD — god context with unrelated concerns
defmodule MyApp.Admin do
  def list_users, do: ...
  def create_product, do: ...
  def process_payment, do: ...
  def send_notification, do: ...
end

# GOOD — separate contexts per domain
defmodule MyApp.Accounts do ... end
defmodule MyApp.Catalog do ... end
defmodule MyApp.Billing do ... end
defmodule MyApp.Notifications do ... end
```

### 14.5 Tight coupling to external services

```elixir
# BAD — domain tightly coupled to Stripe
defmodule MyApp.Billing do
  def charge(order) do
    Stripe.Charge.create(%{amount: order.total, source: order.token})
  end
end

# GOOD — behaviour-based abstraction
defmodule MyApp.Billing do
  @gateway Application.compile_env(:my_app, :payment_gateway)
  def charge(order), do: @gateway.charge(order.total, order.token)
end
```

### 14.6 Business logic in GenServer callbacks

```elixir
# BAD — business logic in the callback
def handle_call({:apply_discount, code}, _from, state) do
  discount = case code do
    "SAVE10" -> Decimal.new("0.10")
    "SAVE20" -> Decimal.new("0.20")
    _ -> Decimal.new("0")
  end
  new_total = Decimal.mult(state.total, Decimal.sub(1, discount))
  {:reply, {:ok, new_total}, %{state | total: new_total}}
end

# GOOD — pure function for logic, GenServer just for state
defmodule MyApp.Pricing do
  def apply_discount(total, code), do: Decimal.mult(total, Decimal.sub(1, rate(code)))
  defp rate("SAVE10"), do: Decimal.new("0.10")
  defp rate("SAVE20"), do: Decimal.new("0.20")
  defp rate(_), do: Decimal.new("0")
end

def handle_call({:apply_discount, code}, _from, state) do
  new_total = MyApp.Pricing.apply_discount(state.total, code)
  {:reply, {:ok, new_total}, %{state | total: new_total}}
end
```

### 14.7 Premature umbrella split

```
# BAD — premature umbrella
apps/
├── auth/               # Used by every other app
├── core/               # Used by every other app
├── web/                # Depends on auth, core, billing, catalog
├── billing/            # Depends on auth, core
├── catalog/            # Depends on auth, core
└── notifications/      # Depends on auth, core, billing, catalog

# GOOD — single app with clean contexts
lib/my_app/
├── accounts.ex
├── billing.ex
├── catalog.ex
└── notifications.ex
```

### 14.8 Wrong supervision strategy

```elixir
# BAD — Registry + DynamicSupervisor under :one_for_one
children = [
  {Registry, keys: :unique, name: MyApp.Registry},
  {DynamicSupervisor, name: MyApp.DynSup}
]
Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)   # WRONG — Registry crash leaves workers orphaned

# GOOD — tightly coupled processes under :one_for_all (or a sub-supervisor with :rest_for_one)
Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_all)
```

### 14.9 Simulating objects with processes

```elixir
# BAD — one Agent per domain concept
cart_agent = Agent.start_link(fn -> Cart.new() end)
inventory_agent = Agent.start_link(fn -> Inventory.new(products) end)
# Every operation needs cross-process messaging to coordinate!

# GOOD — pure functional abstractions
cart = Cart.new()
{:ok, item, inventory} = Inventory.take(inventory, sku)
cart = Cart.add(cart, item)
```

**Rule:** Use functions and modules to separate *thought* concerns. Use processes to separate *runtime* concerns (fault isolation, parallelism, independent lifecycles). If things always change together, keep them together.

### 14.10 Mock lies about real behavior

```elixir
# BAD — mock always returns :ok; hides error paths
Mox.expect(PaymentMock, :charge, fn _, _ -> {:ok, %{id: "tx_123"}} end)
# Tests pass; production crashes on {:error, _} because no code handles it.

# GOOD — test both success AND error paths
test "handles payment failure" do
  Mox.expect(PaymentMock, :charge, fn _, _ -> {:error, :card_declined} end)
  assert {:error, :payment_failed} = Orders.complete_order(order)
end
```

### 14.11 Shared database between contexts

```elixir
# BAD — two contexts writing to the same table
defmodule MyApp.Accounts do
  def update_last_login(user_id), do: Repo.update(...)
end
defmodule MyApp.Analytics do
  def track_login(user_id), do: Repo.update_all(...)  # Also writes users table!
end

# GOOD — one context owns the write; other context is a consumer
defmodule MyApp.Accounts do
  def update_last_login(user_id), do: ...
  # Publishes an event; Analytics subscribes
end
defmodule MyApp.Analytics do
  def handle_info({:user_logged_in, user_id}, state), do: ...
  # Stores analytics in its own tables
end
```

### 14.12 Cross-context `Repo.preload`

```elixir
# BAD — reaching into another context's data with preload
users = MyApp.Accounts.list_users()
|> Repo.preload(orders: :items)    # Orders + items belong to Orders context!

# GOOD — context provides the data shape
users_with_orders = MyApp.Orders.list_users_with_orders(user_ids)
# Orders context assembles the data, exposes it as a well-defined shape
```

### 14.13 Microservices split for "loose coupling"

- "We want loose coupling" → use behaviours and PubSub
- "We want fault isolation" → use supervision trees
- "We want independent scaling" → use process pools, Task.async_stream, Broadway
- "It's getting big" → add contexts

**Microservices are justified for: different languages, compliance isolation, org-level autonomy, or genuinely wildly different scaling needs.** Never for "it feels like it should be."

### 14.14 LiveView stream rendering off external assigns

When a stream row's rendered shape depends on state outside the stream (cluster status, per-member live-computed status, cross-context derivations), attaching that state to a *separate* assign is an architectural bug. LiveView streams are performance-optimized to only re-render rows you re-insert. Updating an unrelated assign (even one the row template reads) does NOT redraw the row — the DOM stays stale.

```
# BAD — design-time shape
Socket assigns:
  :devices (stream)           ← rendered row
  :device_states (%{id => state}) ← influences row rendering
  :cluster_status             ← influences row rendering

handle_info({:device_state_changed, ...}) -> update(:device_states, ...)
  # Row DOM is NOT re-emitted. UI goes stale.

# GOOD — design-time shape
Device schema has virtual :current_state field.
Context function: Fleet.list_with_state/0 populates :current_state.
Stream member carries all row-rendering data.

handle_info({:device_state_changed, id, new_state}) ->
  stream_insert(socket, :devices, Fleet.get_device_with_state!(id))
```

**Why this is planning-level, not implementation-level:** the fix is a schema change (virtual field), a context function change (`list_with_state/0`, `get_device_with_state!/1`), and a Postgres-side shape (often a `DISTINCT ON` subquery). If you design the LV tree with "sidecar assigns for row state" you'll discover the problem during integration testing and have to redesign the schema + context. Decide at planning time: **stream members carry everything a row needs to render.** Any state that changes per-row goes on the member, not on a separate assign.

## 15. Distributed Architecture — Mostly Don't

> **Depth:** [distributed-elixir.md](distributed-elixir.md) — full coverage including node topology, cross-node communication (`:erpc`, `:pg`, `Phoenix.PubSub`), distributed registries (`:global`, Horde, Syn), state distribution patterns (owner-based, replicated/CRDT, sharded, external store), partition handling and netsplit strategies, `libcluster` cluster formation, observability, decision framework, and distribution anti-patterns.

**The one rule that matters:** most Elixir apps don't need distribution. Exhaust single-node options first.

| Problem | Single-node solution | Distribute only when… |
|---|---|---|
| More throughput | `Task.async_stream`, Broadway, more cores | One machine maxed out |
| High availability | Supervisor restarts + blue/green deploy | Zero-downtime across regions required |
| Data locality | ETS caching, read replicas | Users in multiple regions |
| Background jobs | Oban (shares Postgres) | CPU-heavy work exceeds one node |
| WebSocket scale | Single node handles ~1M | More concurrent connections than one machine |

**When to distribute** — at least two of these must be true:
1. Single-node CPU / memory / IO is saturated.
2. Zero-downtime rolling deploys that survive single-node loss are required.
3. Geographic distribution needed (data locality).
4. State naturally partitions and doesn't fit on one node.
5. HA required for persistent in-memory state (presence, game state).

If fewer than two apply, don't distribute. Revisit in 6 months. See `distributed-elixir.md` for the full framework, communication patterns, and netsplit strategies.

## 16. Handoff to `elixir-implementing`

Once the plan is clear, load `elixir-implementing` and write the code. The two skills divide labor as follows:

| Planning decision | Implementation detail |
|---|---|
| Which context owns this? (§6–§7) | Context module structure (`elixir-implementing` §10.1) |
| Do I need a process? (§8.1) | Which GenServer callback, how to structure state (`elixir-implementing` §9) |
| Supervision strategy (§8.3) | Application module + child specs (`elixir-implementing` §9.7) |
| Inter-context mechanism (§9) | GenStage/Broadway/Oban code templates (`elixir-implementing` §9) |
| Behaviour at boundary (§4.4) | `@callback` definition + Mox wiring (`elixir-implementing` §4.4) |
| Config strategy (§10) | `compile_env!` vs `get_env` at call sites (`elixir-implementing` §8.6) |
| Multi-tenancy (§7.6) | `prepare_query` implementation, tenant_id in queries |
| Idempotency (§7.3) | `Oban.insert(unique: ...)` or `on_conflict: :nothing` |
| Circuit breaker placement (§11.2) | `:fuse.ask/2` call patterns |
| Graceful degradation (§11.4) | `case` on result + fallback value |

**Workflow:** Plan here → load `elixir-implementing` → write code → test → review. When a planning decision needs revisiting (e.g., "this context is getting too big"), return to this skill.

### Elixir family

- **[elixir-implementing](../elixir-implementing/SKILL.md)** — the companion skill for daily coding. Decision tables for constructs, idiomatic templates, TDD, testing essentials, OTP callback patterns, anti-patterns Claude produces. Load alongside this skill when planning transitions to implementation.
- **[elixir-reviewing](../elixir-reviewing/SKILL.md)** — review checklist, anti-pattern catalog, debugging + profiling playbooks, performance catalog, security audit. Load when reviewing PRs or auditing existing code.
- **`elixir`** — the original comprehensive Elixir skill with many reference subfiles (architecture-reference, language-patterns, ecto-reference, otp-reference, networking, etc.). This `elixir-planning` skill restructures and improves the architecture-reference content for planning-mode use; load the original for deep reference material beyond what's here.

### Cross-reference summary — for trivial queries without loading

- **Phoenix:** contexts are the public API boundary; routes → controllers → contexts → schemas. Plugs are composable middleware.
- **LiveView:** `mount → handle_params → render`; use streams for large collections; assign everything in `mount/3`.
- **Ash:** resources declare data + behavior; policies authorize; actions mutate.
- **OTP deep:** `gen_statem` for complex FSMs; PartitionSupervisor to shard one-GenServer bottlenecks; `:persistent_term` for hot-path config.
- **Ecto deep:** `Repo.transact/2` (not `transaction/2`); validations run before DB, constraints after; `Multi` for atomic multi-step; composable query functions with pipes.
