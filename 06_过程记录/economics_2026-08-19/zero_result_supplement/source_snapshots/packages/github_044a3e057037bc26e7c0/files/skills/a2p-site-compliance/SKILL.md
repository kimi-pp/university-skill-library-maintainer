name: a2p-site-compliance
description: Use when preparing a client site and copy pack for A2P 10DLC Campaign registration (TextGrid or Telnyx — same TCR registry) — the compliance layer baked into the main marketing site (single-checkbox opt-in consent, Privacy/Terms/SMS-Program pages, the per-client copy-paste Brand+Campaign pack, the working review page, and the verbatim compliance templates filled by deterministic token substitution + a per-niche category library). PREPARES everything A2P registration consumes; the A2P submission itself is deferred and gated (provider go-forward gate — EIN → 10DLC approval + real Telnyx keys). Folds into website-structure, onboard-from-form, admin-view, new-client-site, launch-check, textgrid-provider, telnyx-provider. NOT the backend (scratch-foundation) and NOT the per-client orchestration (new-client-site).

# A2P Site Compliance — carrier-ready site + copy-paste registration pack (Stage-5 / A2P-prep)

> **DUAL-PROVIDER NOTE (2026-07-15):** the generated registration pack (brand fields §G, campaign copy §F, CTA, samples, T&C/privacy URLs) feeds **BOTH providers** — TextGrid AND Telnyx (`/telnyx-provider` §4) register into the **same TCR registry**, so the pack is provider-independent; only the submission mechanics differ (TextGrid paste vs Telnyx 10DLC portal/API). Byte-consistency across the site + whichever provider's submission remains the carrier requirement. Never re-author registration copy per provider.

The **compliance layer that the A2P 10DLC Campaign registration consumes.** A2P registration itself (Brand → Campaign → number) is **deferred and gated** on the **provider go-forward gate — EIN → 10DLC Brand/Campaign approval + real Telnyx account keys** (`/telnyx-provider` §8; the older TextGrid `parent-on-subaccount auth confirm` / HANDOFF §2 LIVE-flip gates were the frozen-path equivalent); this skill **PREPARES everything A2P needs** so that when the gate clears, every field, page, URL, and message sample already exists, is consistent, and is carrier-shaped. It is the bridge between `/onboard-from-form` (capture), `/website-structure` (the site that gets submitted), `/admin-view` (the copy-paste pack), and `/textgrid-provider` §4 / `/telnyx-provider` §4 (the actual registration calls).

## Canonical copy source [SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH]
All carrier-load-bearing boilerplate lives **verbatim** in **`docs/a2p-compliance-copy-source-of-truth.md`** (Sections A–H). That file is authoritative; this skill reproduces its load-bearing copy and operational model. **The wording is LOAD-BEARING — it is what passes 10DLC carrier review. Do NOT paraphrase, summarize, reorder, or "clean up" any of it. AI may fill `{tokens}`; AI may NOT rewrite the compliance language.** If this skill and the canonical doc ever diverge, **the doc wins** — update both together.

## Architecture decision [LOCKED]
- **NO separate lander / compliance microsite / second domain.** A2P compliance is **baked into the MAIN client marketing site.** The real site URL is what gets submitted to A2P as the Campaign's opt-in / message-flow URL — so the live site IS the proof carriers review.
- **Contact email domain MUST equal the site domain.** Prefill the A2P contact email from the site domain and **enforce the match** (capture + admin-view validation). Carriers check domain-match, not deliverability/bounce. This is the #1 hard decline rule.
- **Email-deliverability fallback = known edge, NOT built [documented, not implemented].** If a Campaign is ever declined specifically on email *deliverability* (not domain-match), we set up forwarding on the site domain at that point. Do **not** build mailbox/forwarding infrastructure now.

## Token schema [the one source every surface fills from]
One per-client business-data schema, populated at onboarding; every copy surface (site pages AND the TextGrid paste) draws from it so all copy is **byte-identical** across surfaces (a carrier consistency requirement):

`{business_name}` (legal name as on EIN) · `{dba_name}` · `{contact_email}` (domain == site domain) · `{support_email}` · `{phone}` (display) · `{phone_e164}` · `{address}` / `{street}` / `{city}` / `{state}` / `{zip}` / `{country}` · `{site_url}` · `{privacy_url}` · `{terms_url}` · `{optin_url}` · `{review_link}` (→ the on-site dummy review page) · `{effective_date}` · `{contact_person}` · `{segment}` (vertical — keys the niche library + drives description/sample context) · `{ein}` / `{ein_country}` / `{duns_giin_lei_type}` / `{duns_giin_lei_number}` · **`{customer_care_category}` + `{marketing_category}`** (the two niche-variable consent-category descriptions, filled from the per-niche library keyed by `{segment}` — see the Niche library below).

## Section 0 — Canonical approved reference: Review Harvest LLC [VERBATIM gold standard]

A **real, carrier-APPROVED** A2P campaign (canonical doc §E). It anchors BOTH (a) the per-client copy generation and (b) the `/admin-view` A2P-prep panel's **"view approved example" side-by-side toggle** (Section 3). Generated per-client copy must match this **STRUCTURE**; only tokenized identifiers + niche context change.

**Campaign Description (approved):**
> REVIEW HARVEST LLC sends text messages to users who consent to receive promotional and customer care SMS messages. After the transaction, we request feedback from the user and direct them to Google to leave a review. We only ask for reviews we do not filter these reviews or send any other sort of marketing message. We will follow up via SMS if a user has not left a review. We also may contact our customers via SMS if they have submitted a support request. Msg volume may vary

**Call to Action / Message Flow (approved):**

**Why this shape passes:** named brand in every message; ≥2 explicit STOP/opt-out; real human first names + real values (NO bare `{Name}`/`{Company}` curly fields — carriers reject those); the review/support split mirrors the Description's use cases; the link token resolves to a LIVE page (Section C).

## Section 1 — Website compliance requirements [folds into /website-structure + /new-client-site]

The generated client site carries ALL of the following on the **main marketing site**. `/website-structure` builds them; `/launch-check` §E verifies they shipped. **The copy is the verbatim canonical-doc templates — reproduce byte-for-byte, tokens only.**

### 1.1 Opt-in form (canonical doc §C — verbatim)
ONE consent checkbox (the MARKETING skeleton — **single-checkbox model 2026-07-22**; the former customer-care box was REMOVED), **UNCHECKED by default**, **NOT a condition of service** (form submits without it); **mobile phone REQUIRED, email optional** (form-level):

> **Request Information** — Contact us to learn more about our services and how we can assist with your needs.
> - First Name * · Last Name (Optional) · Mobile Phone Number * · Email Address (Optional)
>
> **☐ (unchecked)** I consent to receive **{marketing_category}** from {business_name} at the phone number provided. Message frequency varies, up to 4 messages per month. Message & data rates may apply. Text HELP for assistance, reply STOP to opt out.
>
> [ Privacy Policy ]({privacy_url}) · [ Terms of Service ]({terms_url}) — **[Submit]**

The "I consent to receive … Message frequency varies … Message & data rates may apply … Text HELP … reply STOP to opt out" wording is the **FIXED compliance skeleton** — never varies. Only the `{marketing_category}` slot varies on the form (Niche library below; `{customer_care_category}` remains a library slot used in the §3 campaign Description/CTA + support samples). *(Layout per the uploaded opt-in form screenshot; the COPY is now the canonical-doc verbatim.)*

**Scope — this is the LEAD / contact opt-in model.** ONE optional checkbox (the marketing skeleton), unchecked + **NOT a condition of service** (carrier-correct), mobile phone REQUIRED + email optional; the frozen `intake` route has **no consent field**, so consent here is **display-only**. **The DISCOUNT form is intentionally different:** it uses a **single REQUIRED** consent checkbox — a **transactional value-exchange opt-in** (claim the discount in return for texts) that **gates submission** and sends `consent: true` (the frozen `discount` route requires `consent: z.literal(true)`). The discount form does **NOT** use this optional surface — instead its single required checkbox **reuses the MARKETING skeleton line above (verbatim, `{marketing_category}` + `{business_name}`), made REQUIRED** (the discount is a promotional offer). (See `/opt-in-forms` §3.)

### 1.2 Privacy Policy page (canonical doc §B — verbatim; NOT generic, names the company)
Reproduce the full Privacy Policy from canonical §B byte-for-byte (tokens only). The **carrier-load-bearing** parts that must appear exactly:
> **IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING TEXT MESSAGING DATA** — {business_name} ("we," "us," or "our") DOES NOT share customer opt-in information, including phone numbers and consent records, with any affiliates or third parties for marketing, promotional, or any other purposes unrelated to providing our direct services. All text messaging originator opt-in data is kept strictly confidential.
>
> **3. SMS Messaging & Compliance** — the Opt-In & Consent / Opt-Out / Message Frequency / Help & Support / Carrier Information bullets (canonical §B.3, verbatim).
>
> **SMS Data Protection Statement** — No mobile information will be shared with third parties/affiliates for marketing/promotional purposes. Information sharing to subcontractors in support services, such as customer service is permitted. … (canonical §B, verbatim).

### 1.3 Terms of Service page (canonical doc §A — verbatim; NOT generic, names the company)
Reproduce the full ToS from canonical §A byte-for-byte (tokens only). The **carrier-load-bearing** part is the **SMS Messaging & Compliance** block, clauses **1–8** + the TCPA/CTIA closing line, which must appear exactly:
> 1. **Program Description** … explicitly opted in … dedicated checkbox for SMS consent …
> 2. **Cancellation Instructions** … text "STOP" … we will confirm your unsubscribe status …
> 3. **Support Information** … reply "HELP" … {support_email} or call {phone} …
> 4. **Carrier Liability** … not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.
> 5. **Message & Data Rates** … Message frequency varies … contact your wireless provider.
> 6. **Supported Carriers** … AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint, and most regional carriers.
> 7. **Age Restriction** … 18 years or older …
> 8. **Privacy Policy** … refer to our Privacy Policy.
> *(+ "We comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and CTIA guidelines …")*

### 1.4 SMS Program page (canonical doc §D — verbatim)
> **SMS Program** — {business_name} may send SMS messages to customers who provide their mobile number and consent. Message frequency may vary. Message & data rates may apply.
> - **Opt out:** Reply **STOP** at any time. — **Help:** Reply **HELP** for assistance. — **Support:** {contact_email} • {phone}
> - For additional details, please review our [Privacy Policy]({privacy_url}) and [Terms of Service]({terms_url}).
> - {business_name} · {address} · {contact_email} • {phone}

*(Layout per the uploaded SMS-Program screenshot; the COPY is now the canonical-doc verbatim.)*

### 1.5 Working review page
The live `{site_url}/review` page (Section C); `{review_link}` in the samples must resolve to it.

### 1.6 Footer links
**Privacy / Terms / SMS Program on every page.** All links working, no typos (Section 4 rule).

### 1.7 Render method [LOCKED — prevents transcription drift]
The Privacy Policy (§B), Terms of Service (§A), and SMS Program (§D) pages render the appendix copy as **normal JSX / markup — NOT `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`** — reproduced **byte-for-byte from the skill's "Appendix — Canonical Verbatim Copy"**, tokens only, the **WHOLE** policy (every clause/section, not excerpts). The build **self-check MUST verify the rendered pages match the appendix exactly** (full §A / §B / §D text with only `{tokens}` substituted) — not merely "renders with tokens." Any divergence from the appendix = transcription drift = a build failure to fix before handoff.

**Quote characters [LOCKED — byte-for-byte means the exact characters]:** reproduce using **straight ASCII quotes** (`"` U+0022 and `'` U+0027) exactly as in the appendix — do **NOT** substitute curly/smart quotes or their HTML entities (`“ ” ‘ ’` / `&ldquo; &rdquo; &lsquo; &rsquo;`). The appendix uses straight ASCII quotes throughout; "byte-for-byte" means the exact characters, not a typographically "nicer" equivalent. (Apostrophes too: `you've`, not `you’ve`.)

---

## Niche library — the two consent-category strings [STRUCTURED + EXTENSIBLE]

The consent checkbox (Section 1.1) and the campaign Call-to-Action paragraph (Section 3) share a **FIXED compliance skeleton** + two niche-variable slots: `{customer_care_category}` and `{marketing_category}`. **Only the category DESCRIPTION is niche-relevant; the compliance mechanics around it are fixed.** The two slots are filled from this per-niche library keyed by `{segment}`. The **same two strings** fill the form AND the A2P submission so they stay byte-consistent. **Single-checkbox model 2026-07-22:** the FORM renders only the `{marketing_category}` line; `{customer_care_category}` still fills the campaign Description/CTA support sentence.

**Seed entries** (grows over time as more niches are approved — append new approved niche blocks here; each entry is JUST the two category-description strings):

| `{segment}` key | `{customer_care_category}` | `{marketing_category}` |
|---|---|---|
| **DEFAULT / generic** (any niche not yet listed) | messages regarding account issues and customer care | promotional messages about new offers |
| **Home services / Plumbing / HVAC / Trades** (seed: Mike's Plumbing) | non-marketing messages about job status updates, estimate follow-ups, and service confirmations | promotional notifications about new services, seasonal maintenance tips, and exclusive savings |
| **Review / reputation service** (seed: Review Harvest) | messages regarding account issues and outages (customer care) | messages regarding new offers (marketing) |

**RULES:**
- A niche block **ONLY** supplies the two category-description strings. It must **NEVER** alter the surrounding compliance language (STOP/HELP/rates/frequency/privacy-link).
- If a niche isn't in the library yet, use the **DEFAULT** block — **never freestyle the consent copy.**
- Add new approved niches by appending a row (key = the `{segment}` value); nothing else changes.

---

## Section 2 — Onboarding-form fields [folds into /onboard-from-form]

Capture these so the pack (Section 3) + the compliant site (Section 1) generate deterministically. These are the **A2P-prep additions** to `/onboard-from-form`; surface + edit them in `/admin-view` Settings like all onboarding values.

- **Agency contact** — kept separate from the client business contact.
- **Client BUSINESS info:** full legal company name (as on EIN) → `{business_name}`; DBA/brand if different → `{dba_name}`; **legal org type** (default **Private Profit**; enum → TextGrid `entityType`); **segment/vertical** (full TextGrid list, canonical §G — keys the niche library + maps to the `vertical` enum KEY in `docs/1f-step6-a2p-registration-field-requirements.md`); **EIN/TIN** + issuer country; optional **DUNS/GIIN/LEI** (+ type); **legal business address/city/state/zip/country** (as on the client's IRS/EIN documents — the registered brand address, written to the new `clients.legal_address` column + editable in `/admin-view` Settings; **MAY DIFFER from the public site address**); **website** (= `{site_url}`); **contact email** (**PREFILL to match the website domain; enforce the match**); **contact phone** (E.164 → `{phone_e164}`); **business description** ("what you do / who you serve / where" — the only AI-bounded generation input, Section B); **logo upload** (≤ 400px); **TCPA / A2P-10DLC attestation checkbox** (required); **business-domain email flag** (Yes → use theirs; No → use an email on the site domain you provide, to keep email-domain == site-domain).

---

## Section 3 — Admin-view A2P-prep panel (per client) [folds into /admin-view]

Per-client panel that **PRE-GENERATES the business-customized registration copy for copy-paste into TextGrid**, filled deterministically from the token schema + niche library, with a **toggle to view the approved Review Harvest example (Section 0) side-by-side.** Templates are canonical §F (campaign) + §G (brand fields).

- **Brand fields (canonical §G):** legal name, DBA, entity type (default Private Profit), segment/vertical, EIN + issuer, DUNS/GIIN/LEI, **legal business address** (from IRS documents; `clients.legal_address`; **MAY DIFFER from the public site address**), **website (= site URL)**, **contact email (= on-site-domain, match-enforced)**, E.164 phone.
- **Campaign Description** — filled template (canonical §F, anchored to §0).
- **Call-to-Action / consent paragraph** — filled template (canonical §F); its `{customer_care_category}`/`{marketing_category}` **MUST be the same niche-library strings** (the form renders the single `{marketing_category}` checkbox — Section 1.1) — single source, so what the campaign claims matches what the form shows.
- **5 sample messages** — canonical §F templates filled with **REAL distinct first names + real values** (NOT literal `{contact_person}`, NOT generic `{Name}`/`{Company}` — carrier reject); **≥ 2 contain STOP**; niche context may reflect `{segment}` but the **structure stays fixed.**
- **Privacy Policy URL + Terms URL** boxes.
- **Side-by-side toggle:** generated per-client copy vs the verbatim §0 Review Harvest approved example, to eyeball structural match before pasting into TextGrid.

---

## Section 4 — Compliance RULES [durable reference — what gets a campaign declined] (canonical §H)

- **Email domain == website domain** — the #1 hard rule (prefill + enforce; deliverability is a non-built fallback).
- **Policies are NOT generic** — they name `{business_name}` with real contact info; both linked in the footer of every page AND referenced in the SMS opt-in.
- **Privacy Policy MUST state** mobile opt-in data is not shared with third parties for marketing (the SMS Data Protection Statement — §1.2).
- **ToS MUST carry the SMS disclosure** (message types, "message frequency may vary," "message & data rates may apply," privacy link, "Text STOP to opt out") — §1.3 clauses 1–8.
- **All links work + no typos** (both are decline triggers — validate links + spellcheck the generated site).
- **Opt-in checkbox (lead/contact opt-in form):** ONE (the marketing skeleton — single-checkbox model 2026-07-22), **unchecked by default**, **optional** (not a condition of service), exact consent language. *(The discount form uses a single REQUIRED consent instead — transactional opt-in; see §1.1.)*
- **Sample messages:** real values (no generic curly fields), ≥2 with STOP, consistent with the campaign description; if a sample contains a URL/phone, flag it in the campaign's "Campaign Attributes."
- **`{review_link}` resolves to a LIVE working page** at submission (the on-site dummy review page) — carriers may click it.

### A. Verbatim templates — RETAIN EXACTLY, do NOT paraphrase or "clean up"
Stored verbatim in **`docs/a2p-compliance-copy-source-of-truth.md`**; the generated site/pack reproduces them byte-for-byte, substituting ONLY the marked tokens. Index:
- **ToS — SMS Messaging Terms & Compliance** (clauses 1–8 + TCPA/CTIA line) → canonical §A (load-bearing excerpt embedded at §1.3).
- **Privacy Policy — SMS section** + **"SMS Data Protection Statement"** + **"IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING TEXT MESSAGING DATA"** header → canonical §B (load-bearing excerpt embedded at §1.2).
- **Opt-in form** — two consent checkboxes (fixed skeleton + niche slots) → canonical §C (embedded at §1.1).
- **SMS Program page** → canonical §D (embedded at §1.4).
- **Campaign Description / CTA / 5 samples** → canonical §F (anchored to the §0 approved structure).
- **Substitution points (the ONLY editable slots):** the token schema above. Everything else in the compliance language is LOCKED.

### B. The substitution mechanism [LOCKED] — verbatim AND business-specific via deterministic token-fill (NOT AI rewriting)
- **EVERY copy surface fills `{tokens}` from the ONE schema** → byte-identical across the site AND the TextGrid paste. This cross-surface consistency is itself a **carrier requirement.**
- **Compliance language = LOCKED template; only tokens vary; AI does NOT rephrase boilerplate.**
- **Niche variability is bounded to the library:** `{customer_care_category}`/`{marketing_category}` come ONLY from the Niche library (keyed by `{segment}`; DEFAULT fallback; never freestyled).
- **The ONLY free generation:** the **business-description text** + the **contextual noun in sample scenarios** (e.g. plumbing vs roofing), from the onboarding description + segment, **anchored to the §0 approved structure.** Sample-message **STRUCTURE stays fixed** (named brand, ≥2 STOP, real values, link token).

### C. The dummy review page [BUILD into the generated site]
- **v1 [frontend-only]:** the `/review` page = the always-present "Review Us" page (`/website-structure`); it must **load + present a working review action** — a **CTA to `client.review_link`** (Google). **No comment box** — `/api/public/intake` hardcodes `source=web_form` and has no review-comment path, so a comment box POSTing there would create a fake lead enrolled in the lead-form drip. `review_link_url` = that page's URL, **prefilled into the sample-message link token.** No new backend route.
- **[BACKLOG]** a real on-site review-capture pipeline (new public route) when the review system is built; when it lands, the URL **matches or gets swapped — note the swap in the handoff.**
- The page **must actually load + accept the review action** (carriers may click it) — not a placeholder/404.

## Cross-references & mirror lines [hand to the user for parity]

Skills/specs that need a pointer at `/a2p-site-compliance`. Anchor points + suggested mirror text (exact placement confirmed with the user at commit):

- **`/onboard-from-form`** — extend the §9b field set + the "A2P field coverage (FLAG)" note with the Section 2 fields (legal name/DBA/entity type/segment→niche-key/EIN+issuer/alt-id/address/website/contact-email domain-match/phone/description/logo/attestation/business-domain-email). *Mirror: "A2P-prep field capture + compliance copy generation → `/a2p-site-compliance` (canonical copy `docs/a2p-compliance-copy-source-of-truth.md`)."*
- **`/website-structure`** — the page set + §9b.C terms/privacy generation produce the Section 1 compliant pages (single-checkbox opt-in, named Privacy/ToS, SMS Program page, footer links, `/review` page), copy verbatim from the canonical doc. *Mirror beside the bot-shield launch-prereq note (PoW — Turnstile RETIRED 2026-07-22).*
- **`/admin-view`** — new per-client **A2P-prep panel** (Section 3) with the side-by-side approved-example toggle; sits with the Settings surfacing of all onboarding values. *Mirror in the Tabs list + Settings notes.*
- **`/new-client-site`** — step 2 (A2P registration) + step 4 (design) reference `/a2p-site-compliance` for the pre-generated pack + compliant pages registration consumes. *Mirror in the launch sequence steps 2 & 4.*
- **`/launch-check`** — §E gains the compliance go-live rows (Section 4 rules: domain-match, named policies, working links, samples real-values + ≥2 STOP, unchecked/optional opt-in, "not shared for marketing" clause, live `/review` page). *Mirror as a new §E checklist block.*
- **`/textgrid-provider` §4** — Campaign registration **consumes** the Section 3 pack (Description, CTA, samples, T&C + privacy URLs); cross-link as the copy/URL source. *Mirror at the Brand/Campaign field references.*
- **Spec §9b/§9c** — per-client model + the A2P-prep compliance layer; cross-ref the canonical copy doc + this skill.

## Notes / open items
- **A2P registration itself is deferred + gated** — this skill only PREPARES. Submission flow + field list: `docs/1f-step6-a2p-registration-field-requirements.md` + `/textgrid-provider` §4 / `/telnyx-provider` §4; the go-forward gate = EIN → 10DLC approval + real Telnyx keys (`/telnyx-provider` §8; the frozen TextGrid LIVE-flip gates were in HANDOFF §2).
- **Email-deliverability domain-match fallback** = known edge, **not built** (forwarding only if a Campaign is declined on deliverability).
- **`vertical` enum mapping** — the Section 2 segment labels (canonical §G) resolve to the TextGrid enum KEYS (`docs/1f-step6-a2p-registration-field-requirements.md`); confirm at build.
- **Review-page URL swap** — when the real review system lands, reconcile `{review_link}` (Section C) and note it in the handoff.
- **Niche library grows** — append approved niche rows over time; DEFAULT covers unlisted niches; consent copy is never freestyled.
- **The compliance surface is BAKED into the STYLE template at build time** (`/template-builder`), so every per-client remix inherits it. Tokens fill at remix from `template_vars`; `{customer_care_category}`/`{marketing_category}` are sourced from the Niche library (keyed by `template_vars.segment`) at onboarding → the SAME values feed the site form AND the §3 admin pack (single source, byte-consistent). The niche is a DATA layer decoupled from the style (any niche × any style). See `docs/stage5-template-builder-build-spec.md`.

## Appendix — Canonical Verbatim Copy

> **This appendix makes the skill SELF-CONTAINED at build time** — it holds the COMPLETE carrier-tested copy directly, so Lovable never reconstructs from excerpts. It is the full verbatim content of `docs/a2p-compliance-copy-source-of-truth.md` (kept in the repo too for human reference + parity). **Reproduce byte-for-byte; fill `{tokens}` only; NEVER paraphrase the compliance language.** The operational model, niche library, and rules above govern HOW this copy is used; the raw copy is below.

# A2P Compliance Copy — VERBATIM SOURCE OF TRUTH (for the a2p-site-compliance skill)

> **PURPOSE.** This file holds the EXACT, carrier-tested boilerplate copy that every generated client site + A2P submission must use. The wording is LOAD-BEARING (it is what passes 10DLC carrier review). It must be stored VERBATIM in the a2p-site-compliance skill and reproduced byte-for-byte on each client site, with ONLY the marked `{tokens}` substituted from the per-client business-data schema. **Do NOT paraphrase, summarize, reorder, or "clean up" any of this copy.** AI may fill tokens; AI may NOT rewrite the compliance language.
>
> **TOKEN SCHEMA** (one source, filled from onboarding; every surface draws from these so all copy is byte-identical across the site + the TextGrid paste):
> `{business_name}` (legal name as on EIN) · `{dba_name}` · `{contact_email}` (domain == site domain) · `{support_email}` · `{phone}` (display) · `{phone_e164}` · `{address}` (full street/city/state/zip) · `{site_url}` · `{privacy_url}` · `{terms_url}` · `{optin_url}` · `{review_link}` (→ the on-site dummy review page) · `{effective_date}` · `{contact_person}` · `{segment}` (vertical — keys the niche copy library + drives description/sample context) · `{customer_care_category}` + `{marketing_category}` (the two niche-variable consent-category descriptions, filled from the per-niche copy library keyed by `{segment}` — see Section C)

## SECTION C — OPT-IN FORM (verbatim template)

> ONE consent checkbox (the marketing skeleton — single-checkbox model 2026-07-22; the former customer-care box was removed), UNCHECKED by default, NOT a condition of service. Mobile phone REQUIRED; email optional. The consent text below is the carrier-load-bearing language. Modeled on the approved Review Harvest consent language + the uploaded form screenshot.

**Request Information** — Contact us to learn more about our services and how we can assist with your needs.

- First Name * (text field)
- Last Name (Optional) (text field)
- Mobile Phone Number * (text field)
- Email Address (Optional) (text field)

**☐ (unchecked)** I consent to receive **{marketing_category}** from {business_name} at the phone number provided. Message frequency varies, up to 4 messages per month. Message & data rates may apply. Text HELP for assistance, reply STOP to opt out.

[ Privacy Policy ]({privacy_url}) · [ Terms of Service ]({terms_url})

**[Submit]**

> **NICHE-LIBRARY MODEL (critical structure).** The consent checkbox = a FIXED compliance skeleton (the "I consent to receive … from {business_name} … message frequency varies … message & data rates may apply … Text HELP … reply STOP to opt out" wording is carrier-load-bearing and NEVER varies) + two niche-variable slots: `{customer_care_category}` and `{marketing_category}`. These two slots are filled from a PER-NICHE COPY LIBRARY keyed by `{segment}` (the business vertical). Only the category DESCRIPTION is niche-relevant; the compliance mechanics around it are fixed. The same two category strings also fill the campaign Call-to-Action paragraph (Section F) so the form and the A2P submission stay byte-consistent. (Single-checkbox model 2026-07-22: the FORM renders only the {marketing_category} line; {customer_care_category} remains a library slot used in the campaign copy.)
>
> **Per-niche copy library (seed entries — grows over time as more niches are approved; add new approved niche blocks here):**
> - **DEFAULT / generic** (any niche not yet in the library): `{customer_care_category}` = "messages regarding account issues and customer care", `{marketing_category}` = "promotional messages about new offers"
> - **Home services / Plumbing / HVAC / Trades** (seed from Mike's Plumbing): `{customer_care_category}` = "non-marketing messages about job status updates, estimate follow-ups, and service confirmations", `{marketing_category}` = "promotional notifications about new services, seasonal maintenance tips, and exclusive savings"
> - **Review/reputation service** (seed from Review Harvest): `{customer_care_category}` = "messages regarding account issues and outages (customer care)", `{marketing_category}` = "messages regarding new offers (marketing)"
> - *(future niches added here as they're approved — each entry is just the two category descriptions; the surrounding compliance language is always the fixed skeleton above)*
>
> RULE: a niche block ONLY supplies the two category-description strings. It must NEVER alter the surrounding compliance language (STOP/HELP/rates/frequency/privacy-link). If a niche isn't in the library yet, use the DEFAULT block — never freestyle the consent copy.

## SECTION E — CANONICAL APPROVED CAMPAIGN REFERENCE (Review Harvest LLC — the gold standard)

> This is a REAL APPROVED 10DLC campaign. It is the source-of-truth example the per-client generator anchors to, and it is shown side-by-side in the admin-view A2P-prep panel as the "approved example." The generated per-client copy must match this STRUCTURE; only tokenized identifiers + niche context change. Stored verbatim.

**Campaign Description (approved):**
REVIEW HARVEST LLC sends text messages to users who consent to receive promotional and customer care SMS messages. After the transaction, we request feedback from the user and direct them to Google to leave a review. We only ask for reviews we do not filter these reviews or send any other sort of marketing message. We will follow up via SMS if a user has not left a review. We also may contact our customers via SMS if they have submitted a support request. Msg volume may vary

## SECTION F — PER-CLIENT CAMPAIGN TEMPLATES (tokenized from Section E)

> These are the templates the admin-view A2P-prep panel fills + displays for copy-paste into TextGrid. Same structure as the approved Review Harvest campaign; tokens from the business-data schema; sample-message structure FIXED, only the contextual nouns + identifiers vary.

**Campaign Description (template):**
{business_name} sends text messages to users who consent to receive promotional and customer care SMS messages. After the transaction, we request feedback from the user and direct them to Google to leave a review. We only ask for reviews we do not filter these reviews or send any other sort of marketing message. We will follow up via SMS if a user has not left a review. We also may contact our customers via SMS if they have submitted a support request. Msg volume may vary

**Call to Action / Message Flow (template):**
Clients will be able to sign up to receive SMS notifications by clicking on {optin_url} at {site_url} (the lead form, also embedded on the homepage). Where they'll see a form to fill out information, and can click a single consent box. The text reads: [ ] I consent to receive {marketing_category} from {business_name} at the phone number provided. Message frequency varies, up to 4 messages per month. Message & data rates may apply. Text HELP for assistance, reply STOP to opt out. Links to our Privacy Policy (containing our SMS Terms) and Terms of Service appear directly beneath the checkbox. Customers who submit a service or support request may also receive {customer_care_category} related to their request. Consent is provided exclusively for {business_name} to contact the user, not any other third parties mentioned on the site. SMS opt-in data is not shared/sold to third parties for promotional/marketing purposes. Privacy Policy URL: {privacy_url}

> The `{customer_care_category}` / `{marketing_category}` here MUST be the same niche-library strings used on the form (Section C — the form renders the single {marketing_category} checkbox) — single source, so what the campaign paragraph claims matches what the form actually renders (a carrier consistency requirement).

**Sample Messages (template — fixed structure, ≥2 with STOP, real values not generic fields):**
1. Hi {contact_person}! Could you take a second to leave a review for {business_name}? It only takes a few clicks, and it helps us out tremendously! Here's the link: {review_link} Reply STOP to opt out. Powered By {business_name}
2. Hi {contact_person}! Would you be willing to leave a review for {business_name}? It only takes 30 seconds! Here's the link: {review_link} Reply STOP to opt out. Powered By {business_name}
3. Hi {contact_person}! Would you be willing to leave a review for {business_name}? It only takes 30 seconds! Here's the link: {review_link} Text STOP to opt out. Powered By {business_name}
4. Hi {contact_person}, thanks for reaching out! We have received your support ticket, please email us at {support_email} or call us at {phone} if you need something in the mean time. We look forward to solving your problem! Text STOP to opt-out. Powered By {business_name}
5. Hi {contact_person}, thanks for reaching out! For any support, please email us at {support_email} or call us at {phone}. We're here to help you! Text STOP to opt-out. Powered By {business_name}

> When filling the 5 samples for submission, use REAL distinct first names (not literal `{contact_person}` and not generic `{Name}`) — generic curly-brace fields are a carrier reject trigger. The niche context (e.g. "review for your recent plumbing service") may reflect {segment}, but the structure stays fixed.

---

## SECTION G — BRAND FIELDS (the A2P Brand registration form — admin-view pre-fills these per client)

---

## SECTION H — COMPLIANCE RULES (durable reference — what gets a campaign declined)

- **Email domain MUST equal website domain** (the #1 hard rule). Prefill {contact_email} from {site_url}'s domain. (Deliverability bounce-testing is a NON-built fallback — if ever declined on it, set up forwarding then.)
- Privacy Policy + ToS are **NOT generic** — they name the company ({business_name}) and give real contact info; both are linked in the footer of every page AND referenced in the SMS opt-in.
- Privacy Policy MUST state mobile opt-in data is not shared with third parties for marketing (the SMS Data Protection Statement — Section B).
- ToS MUST carry the SMS disclosure (message types, "message frequency may vary," "message & data rates may apply," privacy link, "Text STOP to opt out").
- **All links must work; no typos** (both are decline triggers — validate links + spellcheck the generated site).
- Opt-in checkbox: **ONE (marketing skeleton), unchecked by default, optional (not a condition of service)**, with the exact consent language.
- Sample messages: **real values (no generic `{Name}`/`{Company}` curly fields), ≥2 with STOP language, consistent with the campaign description.** If samples contain URLs/phone numbers, flag that in the campaign's "Campaign Attributes."
- `{review_link}` must resolve to a LIVE working page at submission (the on-site dummy review page) — carriers may click it.
