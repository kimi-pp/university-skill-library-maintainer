## Report Integration

When generating a compliance-aware report, use the `--compliance` flag:

```
/vuln-scout:report --compliance pci-dss,hipaa,soc2
```

This appends a Compliance Impact section to the report:

```markdown
## Compliance Impact

### PCI-DSS v4.0
| Requirement | Status | Findings |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| 6.2.4 | FAIL | 3 injection findings |
| 6.4.1 | PASS | No public-facing web app findings |

### HIPAA 164.312
| Section | Status | Findings |
|---------|--------|----------|
| 164.312(a)(1) | FAIL | 2 access control findings |
| 164.312(c)(1) | FAIL | 1 SQL injection finding |
```

## Methodology

### Step 1: Determine Applicable Frameworks
Ask the user which compliance frameworks apply to their organization.

### Step 2: Run Standard Audit
```
/vuln-scout:full-audit .
```

### Step 3: Map Findings to Requirements
Use the mapping table above to categorize each finding by its compliance impact.

### Step 4: Prioritize by Compliance Risk
Findings that affect multiple frameworks should be prioritized higher.

### Step 5: Generate Compliance Report
Include both the technical finding details and the compliance requirement references.

## Integration with Other Skills

- Use **business-logic** for access control requirement mapping (PCI-DSS 6.5.4, HIPAA 164.312(a))
- Use **cryptographic-failures** for encryption requirements (HIPAA 164.312(e), PCI-DSS 6.2.4)
- Use **logging-failures** for audit control requirements (HIPAA 164.312(b), SOC 2 CC7.1)
- Use **security-misconfiguration** for baseline hardening requirements
