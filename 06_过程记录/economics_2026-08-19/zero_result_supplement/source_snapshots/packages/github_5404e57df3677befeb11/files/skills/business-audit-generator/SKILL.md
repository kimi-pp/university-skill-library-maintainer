## Usage Scenarios

### Basic Report Generation
```python
from business_audit_generator import BusinessAuditGenerator

generator = BusinessAuditGenerator()
report = generator.generate_weekly_briefing()
print(report.summary)
```

### Custom Data Analysis
```python
# Analyze specific data sets
task_data = get_task_data()
financial_data = get_financial_data()
goal_data = get_goal_data()

analysis = generator.analyze_data_sets(
    tasks=task_data,
    finances=financial_data,
    goals=goal_data
)

# Generate custom report
custom_report = generator.generate_custom_report(analysis)
```

### Scheduled Generation
```python
# Integrate with scheduler for weekly generation
from scheduler_cron_integration import Scheduler

scheduler = Scheduler()
job_id = scheduler.schedule_job(
    name="weekly_ceo_briefing",
    cron_expression="0 8 * * 1",  # Every Monday at 8 AM
    callback=generator.generate_and_send_briefing,
    description="Generate and send weekly CEO briefing"
)
```

## Integration Points

### With Task Management Systems
- Pull task completion data
- Analyze workload distribution
- Identify bottlenecks and resource allocation issues

### With Financial Systems
- Aggregate spending data
- Analyze budget variances
- Track expense category trends

### With Goal Tracking Platforms
- Monitor goal progress
- Calculate achievement rates
- Identify milestone completions

### With Claude Code
- Integrate with existing workflows
- Automate data collection processes
- Generate natural language summaries

## Data Processing Pipeline

### Data Collection Phase
1. Fetch task data from task management systems
2. Retrieve financial transactions from accounting systems
3. Collect goal progress from tracking platforms
4. Gather operational metrics from various sources

### Data Analysis Phase
1. Clean and normalize data
2. Calculate performance metrics
3. Identify trends and patterns
4. Detect anomalies and outliers
5. Assess risk factors

### Report Generation Phase
1. Compile analyzed data into report structure
2. Generate executive summaries
3. Create visualizations
4. Format for distribution
5. Send to stakeholders

## Security Considerations
- Secure data access with proper authentication
- Encrypt sensitive financial data
- Implement access controls for reports
- Audit data access and report generation

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient data processing algorithms
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Asynchronous processing for large datasets
- Optimized database queries

## Dependencies
- `pandas` for data analysis
- `matplotlib` for visualization
- `jinja2` for report templating
- `requests` for API integrations
- `structlog` for structured logging
## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **Real-time operational dashboards** — this skill generates periodic briefings, not live dashboards; use a BI tool for real-time monitoring
- **Detailed financial audits requiring accountant review** — AI-generated business intelligence does not replace professional financial auditing
- **Organizations without structured task/transaction data** — the briefing quality depends on clean input data; unstructured data produces unreliable reports

## Common Mistakes

- Running the briefing without validating input data quality first — garbage-in produces garbage KPIs that mislead executives
- Not specifying the reporting period — default behavior may aggregate all-time data instead of the current week
- Treating the generated briefing as factually authoritative without human review — always have a human verify numbers against source systems before distributing
