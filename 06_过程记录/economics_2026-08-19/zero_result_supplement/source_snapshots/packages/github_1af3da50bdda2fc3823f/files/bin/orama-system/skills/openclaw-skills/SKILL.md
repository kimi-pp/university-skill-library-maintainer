# OpenClaw Skills

## Purpose

Canonical master skill for The Nine Skills that configure OpenClaw instances deterministically across supported harnesses.

## When to Use

- Adding channels, cron jobs, agents, secrets, or scripts to OpenClaw
- Running `openclaw-stow`, `openclaw-restart`, or `openclaw-status`
- Any agent must execute OpenClaw fabric operations instead of improvising from memory

This folder is the canonical home for The Nine Skills used to operate OpenClaw configuration. These skills are executable standards, not passive docs: every supported agent must use the relevant skill instead of reconstructing OpenClaw procedures from memory.

The skills are designed for deterministic use through direct skill loading, MCP middleware, CLI wrappers, editor rules, or Perpetua-Tools dispatch. They must produce the same files, naming, model routing, stow behavior, and restart flow regardless of the invoking agent.

## The Nine Skills

| Skill ID | Purpose | Skill File |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------ |
| `openclaw-new-agent` | Creates a complete agent entry, directory tree, required directive files, script folders, and optional parent/child wiring. | [skills/openclaw-new-agent/SKILL.md](skills/openclaw-new-agent/SKILL.md) |
| `openclaw-add-channel` | Adds Telegram, Slack, or WhatsApp channels and runs the full secrets, config, stow, restart, and verification pipeline. | [skills/openclaw-add-channel/SKILL.md](skills/openclaw-add-channel/SKILL.md) |
| `openclaw-add-cron` | Adds recurring, interval, or one-shot scheduled jobs while handling transient `jobs.json` safely. | [skills/openclaw-add-cron/SKILL.md](skills/openclaw-add-cron/SKILL.md) |
| `openclaw-dream-setup` | Configures nightly memory distillation, memory files, archives, cron, QMD indexes, and startup sequence updates. | [skills/openclaw-dream-setup/SKILL.md](skills/openclaw-dream-setup/SKILL.md) |
| `openclaw-add-script` | Scaffolds deterministic shell scripts with JSON-only stdout, stderr logging, strict shell flags, and tool docs. | [skills/openclaw-add-script/SKILL.md](skills/openclaw-add-script/SKILL.md) |
| `openclaw-add-secret` | Stores credentials through macOS Keychain and updates all required shell/provisioning secret files. | [skills/openclaw-add-secret/SKILL.md](skills/openclaw-add-secret/SKILL.md) |
| `openclaw-status` | Runs the standard health check for gateway, launchd, channels, agents, cron jobs, and recent errors. | [skills/openclaw-status/SKILL.md](skills/openclaw-status/SKILL.md) |
| `openclaw-restart` | Performs the canonical restart sequence: remove transient cron state, stow, kickstart, wait, and verify channels. | [skills/openclaw-restart/SKILL.md](skills/openclaw-restart/SKILL.md) |
| `openclaw-stow` | Deploys OpenClaw config through GNU Stow with `jobs.json` conflict handling baked in. | [skills/openclaw-stow/SKILL.md](skills/openclaw-stow/SKILL.md) |

## Upstream Initialization

Before resolving any of The Nine Skills directly, ensure the upstream submodule is present:

```bash
bash scripts/install-openclaw-skills.sh
```

This is idempotent and is also called by `start.sh`. Orama-normalized Nine Skill
overlays live under `skills/<skill-id>/SKILL.md`; each overlay declares the
upstream cc-openclaw card it extends under
`cc-openclaw/.claude/skills/<skill-id>/SKILL.md`.

## Universal Invocation Protocol

All agents must follow [references/universal-skill-protocol.md](references/universal-skill-protocol.md).

The required invocation envelope is:

```json
{
  "skill_id": "openclaw-add-secret",
  "args": {
    "secret_name": "telegram-bot-token"
  },
  "agent_id": "codex",
  "openclaw_home": "/absolute/path/to/openclaw-home"
}
```

The required result shape is:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "files_modified": [],
  "follow_up_actions": []
}
```

Wrappers may add transport metadata, but they must preserve the envelope fields and the result fields. Skill chaining is allowed only when the parent skill declares the internal call and preserves the same `openclaw_home`.

## OpenClaw CLI Resolution (when `openclaw` seems broken)

Before concluding "openclaw is not installed" or acting on a `Cannot find module '.../.local/openclaw/openclaw.mjs'` error, **look at the right places.** That error is a known false alarm: `~/.local/bin/openclaw` is a pnpm cmd-shim reached through a symlink, and its `$0`-derived basedir resolves to a path that never existed. Meanwhile up to **three** openclaw installs can coexist on one machine:

| Install | Role |
| --------- | ------ |
| npm-global under nvm node (e.g. `~/.nvm/.../vNN/lib/node_modules/openclaw`) | **canonical** — runs the launchd gateway, newest |
| `$OPENCLAW_ROOT/AlphaClaw/node_modules/openclaw` (pnpm) | older, repo-local |
| `~/.alphaclaw/node_modules/openclaw` | **stale orphan — never use** (disabled to `.disabled-*-STALE`) |

**Always resolve through the canonical resolver** rather than trusting the bare command blindly:

```bash
# one-liner (echoes "<node>\t<entrypoint>")
"$(orama_git_root)/scripts/openclaw/resolve-openclaw.sh" --which

# or source the lib and use the helpers
source bin/orama-system/scripts/lib/openclaw-env.sh
openclaw_cmd plugins list        # runs canonical openclaw, never the stale one
resolve_openclaw_cli             # prints node + entrypoint of the canonical install
```

The resolver prefers the install that actually runs the gateway (parsed from the launchd plist), falls back to npm-global then the AlphaClaw repo copy, blacklists the stale `~/.alphaclaw` install, and verifies `--version` before returning. `setup_macos.py` installs `~/.local/bin/openclaw` as a thin wrapper around it, so the bare `openclaw` command self-heals on every `start.sh`. Full rationale: [`scripts/openclaw/resolve-openclaw.sh`](../../../scripts/openclaw/resolve-openclaw.sh) header.

Note the active config may be written by a newer OpenClaw than a given on-disk CLI (e.g. config `2026.6.8` vs a pnpm `2026.5.6`). Prefer the gateway's own version for config writes; `config patch`/`config set` from the canonical CLI is the gateway-aware, validated, atomic path (never hand-edit live `openclaw.json`).

## Default Model Routing

Use [references/openrouter-defaults.md](references/openrouter-defaults.md) as the source of truth for default model routing.

Local-first on Mac:

1. `ollama/qwen3.5:9b-nvfp4`
2. `qwen3-coder:480b-cloud` when loaded for heavy code work
3. OpenRouter fallback stack

OpenRouter fallback stack:

| Tier | Model ID | Role |
| ------ | ---------- | ------ |
| A | `openrouter/nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free` | Default agent brain |
| B | `openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.5:free` | Coding fallback |
| C | `openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash:free` | Fast triage |
| D | `openrouter/openai/gpt-oss-120b:free` | Reasoning and tool use |
| E | `openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.5-air:free` | Agentic backup |
| F | `openrouter/inclusionai/ling-2.6-flash:free` | Lightweight tasks |
| Z | `openrouter/openrouter/free` | Last-resort auto-router |

Gemini is specialized only and is not the default fallback. Reserve it for visual diff, screenshot comparison, whole-repo architecture mapping, stale-doc detection, or explicit second-opinion review.

## PT-Orama Recursive Spawn

OpenClaw deployment is recursive across three layers:

| Layer | Role | Responsibility |
| ------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| L3 | `orama-system` | Owns these canonical skill definitions and routing policy. |
| L2 | Perpetua-Tools middleware | Receives agent-neutral skill envelopes, resolves `openclaw_home`, runs tools, and returns normalized results. |
| L1 | OpenClaw instance | Applies config changes, starts agents, routes messages, schedules jobs, and may spawn child OpenClaw instances. |

Standard L3 to L1 dispatch:

```text
orama-system
  -> Perpetua-Tools skill dispatcher
  -> openclaw-skills/{skill_id}
  -> target OpenClaw home
  -> files changed, stowed, restarted, verified
```

Nested OpenClaw recursion:

```text
parent OpenClaw agent
  -> emits universal skill envelope
  -> Perpetua-Tools resolves child openclaw_home
  -> child OpenClaw invokes the same canonical skill
  -> child may later repeat the same pattern for its own sub-instance
```

Recursive spawn constraints:

1. Every invocation must carry an explicit `openclaw_home`.
2. A nested call must use the same skill IDs listed in this master file.
3. A sub-agent must be wired to its parent's `allowAgents` list in `openclaw.json`.
4. The parent may delegate, but the skill remains authoritative for naming, file layout, stow, restart, and verification.
5. Results must bubble upward in the universal output format so L3, L2, and L1 can audit the same record.

## Naming Conventions Enforced

| Item | Convention | Example |
| ------ | ------------ | --------- |
| Keychain service | `openclaw.<name>`, lowercase, hyphens | `openclaw.telegram-bot-token` |
| Environment variable | `OPENCLAW_<NAME>`, uppercase, underscores | `OPENCLAW_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` |
| Agent ID | lowercase, hyphens | `insurance-agent` |
| Script output | stdout = JSON only | `{"status": "ok", "result": "..."}` |
| Script logging | stderr only | `echo "Processing..." >&2` |

Every generated agent requires:

| File or Directory | Purpose |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| `SOUL.md` | Identity, personality, operating principles |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Name, role, model assignment |
| `USER.md` | Relationship context and user preferences |
| `AGENTS.md` | Sub-agent wiring and session startup sequence |
| `TOOLS.md` | Available tools and script documentation |
| `SECURITY.md` | Credential handling policy |
| `memory/` | Agent memory root |
| `memory/archives/` | Long-term memory archive location |
| `scripts/` | Agent-local scripts |
| `scripts/lib/` | Shared script libraries |

Every secret touches all three files:

| File | Purpose | Consequence if missing |
| ------ | --------- | ------------------------ |
| `openclaw-secrets.sh` | Loaded by launchd at gateway startup | Gateway cannot read the secret |
| `openclaw-env.sh` | Sourced by shell for CLI commands | Terminal can raise `MissingEnvVarError` while gateway works |
| `secrets.sh` | Provisioning script for fresh machines | Disaster recovery fails silently |

## Operational Rules

1. Never freestyle OpenClaw configuration. Use the relevant skill for every configuration change.
2. Run `openclaw-status` before changes to understand current gateway, launchd, channel, agent, cron, and error state.
3. Run `openclaw-restart` after config changes. Do not use raw `launchctl kickstart` as the operational restart path.
4. Treat `~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json` as transient. The gateway regenerates it on startup; never treat it as source of truth.
5. Never echo secrets to terminal, files, logs, prompts, result envelopes, or git history.
6. When creating a sub-agent, wire it to the parent's `allowAgents` list in `openclaw.json`.
7. Use `stow --no-folding` for all stow operations so the symlink structure is preserved.
8. After updating the source skill distribution, re-run stow if new skills were added.

## Quick Reference

| Command | When to Use |
| --------- | ------------- |
| `openclaw-new-agent` | Creating any new agent |
| `openclaw-add-channel` | Adding Telegram, Slack, or WhatsApp integration |
| `openclaw-add-cron` | Scheduling any recurring or one-shot job |
| `openclaw-dream-setup` | Setting up nightly memory distillation for an agent |
| `openclaw-add-script` | Creating a new deterministic shell script |
| `openclaw-add-secret` | Storing any API key or credential |
| `openclaw-status` | Diagnosing any problem; run this first |
| `openclaw-restart` | After any config change |
| `openclaw-stow` | After manual file edits only |

## Agent Compatibility Notes

Hermes support is intentionally cross-harness: use
[`../hermes-harness/SKILL.md`](../hermes-harness/SKILL.md) for Hermes
installation, Nous Portal/LM Studio provider setup, and ECC skill-import rules.
Use this OpenClaw skill pack for OpenClaw configuration and gateway operations.

| Agent | Discovery | Invocation |
| ----- | --------- | ---------- |
| Claude | Skill tool or local skill folder scan | Load this master `SKILL.md`, then the selected subskill |
| Hermes | MCP or local markdown skill registry | Send universal JSON envelope to the skill runner |
| Gemini | `gemini-mcp-tool` wrapper | Invoke through MCP with the universal envelope |
| Codex | `ai-cli-mcp` or local skill path | Invoke selected skill with explicit `openclaw_home` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/` mirror or linked skill docs | Rule triggers should call the same skill IDs |
| WindSurf | Workspace rules or MCP adapter | Resolve skill ID and execute through the protocol |
| Antigravity | Agent rules or MCP adapter | Dispatch envelope to Perpetua-Tools |
| OpenCode | Local command, MCP, or rules adapter | Use skill ID plus args exactly as declared |
| 8gent.dev | Agent registry or MCP adapter | Dispatch normalized envelope and preserve output shape |

If an agent cannot load markdown skills directly, it must use Perpetua-Tools or an equivalent wrapper that reads this folder and executes the same procedures.

## Attribution

The Nine Skills originate from [cc-openclaw](https://github.com/rahulsub-be/cc-openclaw)
(MIT, Rahul Subramanian). The upstream lives at `cc-openclaw/` (git submodule), with
canonical upstream skill cards in `cc-openclaw/.claude/skills/`.

Extensions in this directory (`references/`, `templates/`, `scripts/`, this `SKILL.md`)
are orama-system additions and are NOT in the upstream repo.

Layer 0 (provider substrate): `v1/OpenRouter.md` — free model stack, openclaw.json shape,
rate limits. See `references/openrouter-defaults.md` for the distilled routing table.

cc-openclaw = `v1/OpenRouter.md` (Layer 0 substrate) + `.claude/skills/` (Layer 1 ops).
The Orama-normalized overlay cards are in `openclaw-skills/skills/`. Shared
extensions live at `openclaw-skills/` root.

## Search Frugality Rule

**RULE: Never guess when information is scarce.**
Search in this order — stop at the first satisfying result:

1. `/sync-gbrain` + `gbrain query "<question>"` — local semantic memory, zero cost
2. `code-review-graph: semantic_search_nodes` — structural code context
3. Brave Search API — web facts, current state
4. Perplexity API (inline) — deep web synthesis
5. Grok API — last resort only

**NEVER:** parallel-fire all search tools. Use the cheapest first.
**ALWAYS:** `AskUserQuestion` for decisions — never auto-select between ambiguous options.

## Windows Coder Policy

**RULE: Every available Windows coder MUST be given work as soon as it is idle.**

Endpoint pool: `$WIN_CODER_ENDPOINTS` (default: `192.168.254.103:1234`)

Dispatch protocol:

1. Before routing any task to Mac-only paths, check if a Windows coder is free.
2. If free AND task is compatible (Python, Go, TypeScript, general coding):
   → dispatch to Windows coder FIRST.
3. If offline or no model loaded: skip silently, log WARN, do not fail.
4. As more Windows coders are added to `$WIN_CODER_ENDPOINTS`, they join the pool
   automatically — same rule applies to all.

**Never leave a Windows coder idle if pending compatible work exists.**

## Boundaries

### Always Do

- Route all nine OpenClaw fabric skills through this protocol and overlay cards.
- Initialize `cc-openclaw` submodule before discovery.
- Use env placeholders for `openclaw_home`; never hardcode workstation paths.
- Follow search frugality order (gbrain → code-review-graph → web).

### Ask First

- Adding a tenth skill ID or changing the universal invocation envelope.
- Modifying upstream cc-openclaw submodule pins without merge review.

### Never Do

- Put secrets in invocation envelopes or skill examples.
- Bypass overlay cards and edit upstream cc-openclaw skills as canonical truth.
- Parallel-fire all search tools when the cheapest single source suffices.
